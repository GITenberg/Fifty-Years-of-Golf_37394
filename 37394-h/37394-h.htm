<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Written in 1914</i>)</p>


<p>I agreed to the suggestion that I should write
these reminiscences, mainly because it seems to
me that circumstances have thrown my life along such
lines that I really have been more than any other
man at the centre of the growth of golf&mdash;a growth
out of nothingness in England, and of relative littleness
in Scotland, fifty years ago, to its present condition
of a fact of real national importance. I saw
all the beginnings, at Westward Ho! of the new life
of English golf. I followed its movement at Hoylake
and later at Sandwich. I was on the Committee
initiating the Amateur Championship, the International
Match, the Rules of Golf Committee and
so on. I have been Captain in succession of the
Royal North Devon, Royal Liverpool, Royal St.
George's and Royal and Ancient Clubs, as well as
many others, and in these offices have been not only
able but even obliged to follow closely every step in
the popular advancement of the game. I do not
mention these honours vaingloriously, but only by
way of showing that no one else perhaps has had
quite the same opportunities.</p>

<p>Possibly I should explain, too, the apparent magniloquence
of the phrase describing golf as a "fact
of real national importance." I do not think it is an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
over-statement. I use it irrespective of the intrinsic
merits of the game, as such. When we consider the
amount of healthy exercise that it gives to all ages
and sexes, the amount of money annually expended
on it, the area of land (in many places otherwise
valueless) that is devoted to it, the accession in house
and land values for which it is responsible, the miles
of railway and motor travel of which it is the reason,
the extent of house building of which it has been
the cause, and the amount of employment which it
affords&mdash;when these and other incidental features
are totalled up, it will be found, I think, that there
is no extravagance at all in speaking of the golf of
the present day as an item of national importance.
At least, if golf be not so, it is difficult to know what
is.</p>

<p>It is because I have in my head the material for the
telling of the history of this rise of golf to its present
status that I have ventured to write these personal
reminiscences, and underlying them all has been the
sense that I was telling the story of the coming of
golf, as well as narrating tales of the great matches
and the humorous incidents that I have seen and taken
part in by the way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h2>POSTSCRIPT TO PREFACE</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Written in 1919</i>)</p>


<p>Reading the above "foreword," and also the
pages which follow it, after the immense chasm cleft
in our lives and habits by the War, I find little to
modify as a result of the delay in publication. What
does strike me with something very like a thrill of
terror is the appalling egotism of the whole. I can
truly say that I feel guiltily aware and ashamed of it.
I cannot, however, say that I see my way clear to amend
it. If one is rash enough to engage in the gentle
pastime of personal reminiscence at all, it is difficult
to play it without using the capital "I" for almost
every tee shot. I will ask pardon for my presumption
in plucking a passage from one of the world's great
classics, to adorn so slight a theme as this, and will
conclude in the words of Michael, Lord of Montaigne:&mdash;"Thus,
gentle Reader, myselfe am the groundworke
of my booke: it is then no reason thou shouldst
employe thy time about so frivolous and vaine a
subject."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h4>THE BEGINNING OF ALL THINGS</h4>


<p>I believe it is a little more than fifty years
really. I do not mean to imply that I have been
for that length of time actively engaged in the serious
pursuit of the golf ball, but I expect that I began
to take interest in what I understood as golf about
the age of four. At that time my father was at Government
House in Devonport, as General in Command
of the Western District, and my Uncle Fred, Colonel
Hutchinson, used to come there and tell us of some
game, the most wonderful in the world, that he had
lately learned to play when he was in Scotland, as
Adjutant of the Fife Militia. He lived at Wemyss
Hall, in Fife, and used to ride over to St. Andrews,
breakfasting <i>en route</i> with Mr. Bethune of Blebo,
and taking him on along with him, for a round or
two rounds.</p>

<p>I used to hear a great deal of talk about this wonderful
game, between my father and my uncle, the former
having scarcely a more clear-cut idea of what it was
like than I myself; but I can well remember his
attempting to give some description of it, in my
uncle's absence, to a friend, and hearing this remark:
"A man knows his own weapon, that he uses in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
game, and it is as important to him to have the weapon
that he knows as it is to a billiard player to have
his own cue. And they use several different kinds
of weapon at the game, for strokes of different strength."</p>

<p>All that seems quite credible now; but it hardly
seemed possible of belief in the South of England
in the early sixties. I even knew what the weapon
was called&mdash;"a club"&mdash;for I often asked my uncle
about it, and he tried, with poor success, to make
me understand its character; for I tried, in turn,
to describe it to one of the orderlies, who was a particular
friend of myself (or of my nurse), and he made
me what he thought fitted the description. It fitted
the name of "club"&mdash;for it was much like what
the cannibals, in our boys' books, were depicted
as using on the heads of their victims; but when
I showed it to my uncle he shook his head sadly.
It did not appeal to him as having any likeness to
the delicate works of Hugh Philp, that master club-maker,
with which he was familiar. Still, I did
beat a ball about with it, and thus began golf.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the age of five, we went to live
at a house called Wellesbourne, in North Devon,
about halfway between Bideford and Northam.
Westward Ho! in those days did not exist. There
was one farmhouse where all the houses of the watering-place
now are. The very name belonged only
to Charles Kingsley's fine book, and was only taken
for the name of the place a year or so later than
this. Captain Molesworth, to whom English golf
was to owe a big debt, lived at a house called North
Down, just at the entry into Bideford, and it was
in this house that Charles Kingsley was living while
writing <i>Westward Ho!</i> That is the story of how
the name came to be given to the place, and Borough
House, by Northam, was about half a mile from
our Wellesbourne. This Borough House, since restored,
is where Mrs. Leigh, with her sons Frank and Amyas,
were placed by the novelist.</p>

<p>The Reverend I.H. Gossett was Vicar of Northam,
and related to the large family of Moncrieffes, of
whom there were several resident then at St. Andrews.
About that time one of its members, General Moncrieffe,
came on a visit to his relative, the vicar of
Northam, and from that chance visit great events
grew. For Mr. Gossett, as it was likely he should,
led out General Moncrieffe for a walk across that
stretch of low-lying common ground known as the
Northam, or Appledore, Burrows, to the famous
Pebble Ridge and the shores of Bideford Bay; and
as they went along and reached the vicinity of those
noble sandhills later to be known to golfing fame and
to be execrated by golfing tongues as "the Alps,"
the General observed: "Providence obviously designed
this for a golf links."</p>

<p>To a man coming from St. Andrews it was a fact
that jumped to the eyes. It was not for a clergyman
to stand in the way of a design so providential. Mr.
Gossett was a very capable, effective man: he had
a family including some athletic sons for whom a
game such as described by General Moncrieffe seemed
likely to provide just the outlet which their holiday
energies would need. He threw himself heartily
into the work of getting a few to join together to
make the nucleus of a club; but that first of English
Golf Clubs, next after&mdash;very long after&mdash;the fearful
antiquity of Blackheath, and absolutely first to play
on a seaside links, did not involve all the outlay on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
green and club-house without which no golf club
can respect itself to-day.</p>

<p>Clubs and balls&mdash;"gutty" balls, for the feather-cored
leather-cased ones had already been superseded&mdash;would
be sent, as needed, on General Moncrieffe's
order, from Tom Morris' shop at St. Andrews,
and when that was done all was done that was needed
for these little beginnings of the seaside golf of England.
The turf grew naturally short, and the commoners'
sheep helped to check any exuberance. The course,
as designed by those primitive constructors, acting
under the advice of General Moncrieffe, started out
near the Pebble Ridge, by what is now the tee to the
third hole. Those pioneers of the game did not even
go to the expense, in the first instance, of a hole cutter.
They excised the holes with pocket knives. The
putting greens were entirely <i>au naturel</i>, as Nature and
the sheep made them. Assuredly there was no need for
the making of artificial bunkers. Nature had provided
them, and of the best. Besides, were there
not always the great sea rushes? It may be remembered
that the old golf rules have the significant
regulation that the ball shall not be teed "nearer
than four club-lengths" to the hole. That indicates
both a less sanctity ascribed to putting greens of
old and also a less degree of care lavished on teeing
grounds. There were no flags, to mark the holes;
but the mode was for the first party that went out
on any day to indicate, if they could discover it,
the position of the hole, for those coming after them,
by sticking in a feather of gull or rook picked up
by the way. If, as might happen, the hole was not
to be discovered, being stamped out or damaged
by sheep beyond all recognition as a respectable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
golf hole, this first party would dig another hole with
a knife, and set up the signal feather beside that.
In this period of the simple golfing life it goes without
the saying that no apology, or substitute even, for
a club-house gave shelter to these hardy primitive
golfers. The way was to throw down coat, umbrella,
or other superfluity beside the last hole. They
were safe, for two good reasons&mdash;that they were
not worth stealing and that there was no one to steal
them. And it is to be supposed that in those good
old days there was none of the modern "congestion,"
of which we hear so much. Golfers and their needs,
in England at all events, were alike few and simple.</p>

<p>The Club was instituted in 1864; therefore it has
now passed its jubilee; but I, unhappily, have to
look back upon many of those early years as so many
periods of wasted opportunity. That same Uncle
Fred who had condemned the club of the cannibal,
gave me my first true golf club. Years afterwards an
anxious mother asked him, "At what age do you
think my little boy should begin golf: I want him
to be a very good player?"</p>

<p>"How old is the boy now?" my uncle asked.</p>

<p>"Seven," the mother replied.</p>

<p>"Seven!" he repeated sadly. "Oh, then he has
lost three years already!"</p>

<p>I was given a club long before I was seven, but our
house was two long miles from the course, and miles
are very long for the short legs of seven. There were
the fields, but though it is reported of Queen Mary
Stuart that she found agreeable solace in playing at
golf in "the fields around Seaton house," I did not
find golf exhilarating in the fields around Wellesbourne
House. But the atmosphere of golf was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
about the house. The Golf Club prospered, as golfing
prosperity was rated in that day of small things. The
extraordinary news went abroad that it was now
possible to play the game of Scotland on real links
turf in this corner of Devon. Men of renown, such
as Mr. George Glennie, Mr. Buskin, and many besides
came from the ancient club at Blackheath, and stayed
for golf at the hotel recently built at that place which
had now received its name from Kingsley's book.
Sir Robert Hay and Sir Hope Grant, the former
one of the finest amateurs of a past day and the latter
more distinguished as a soldier than a golfer, came as
guests, for golfing purposes, to my father's house.
My two brothers, both in the Army and from twelve
to nineteen years older than myself, played a few
games when home on leave. I was too young to
take any part in a match, but not too young to listen
to much talk about the game and to look with profound
veneration on its great players.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h4>HOW GOLF IN ENGLAND GREW</h4>


<p>There are two outstanding events in golfing
history&mdash;the bringing of golf to Westward
Ho! by General Moncrieffe in 1863, and the bringing
of golf to Blackheath by James VI. of Scotland and
I. of England some three centuries earlier. When
golf was started at Westward Ho! it was the worthies
of the Blackheath Club that gave it a reputation which
went growing like a snowball. The North Devon Club
began to wax fat and so exceeding proud that at
meeting times&mdash;for challenge medals were presented
and meetings in spring and autumn were held to
compete for them, after the model of St. Andrews&mdash;a
bathing machine was dragged out by coastguards
to the tee to the first hole, and therein sandwiches
and liquid refreshment were kept during the morning
round and actually consumed if the weather were wet.
In fine weather the entertainment was <i>al fresco</i>. Then
the Club acquired a tent; and an ancient mariner,
Brian Andrews, of Northam village, father of the
Philip Andrews who is now steward of the Golf Club,
used to hoist this and care for it, and at length, as
of natural process of evolution, came the crowning
glory of a permanent structure of corrugated iron,
built beside and even among the grey boulders of
the Pebble Ridge.</p>

<p>This permanent object of care entailed the per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>manency
of Brian Andrews as caretaker. Enormous
was the career of extravagance on which the Club
now embarked, engaging a resident professional all
the way from St. Andrews&mdash;John Allan. He was the
first Scot ever to come to England as a resident golf
professional, and there never came a kinder-hearted
or better fellow. He established himself in a lodging,
with his shop and bench on the ground floor, in Northam
village, which stands high on a hill above the
level of the links, and was best part of a mile and
a half from the present third, and then first, tee.
A few years before, in the earliest days of the Club's
history, old Tom Morris had been down to advise
about the green, and when I came to my teens and
therewith to some interest in golf, and to a friendship,
very quickly formed, with poor Johnnie Allan, he
told me that when he had asked old Tom for information
about this new course in the new country that
he was going to, he found that the old man (though
he was not of any great age then) could tell him
little enough about the course, but that all he seemed
to remember was that there was a terrible steep hill
to climb, after the day's work was done, on the way
home.</p>

<p>So there is&mdash;Bone Hill, on which the village stands,
so called from the bones of Danes killed in a great
battle there, and of which bones, as we piously believed,
the hill, save for a thin coat of soil over their graves,
was wholly made&mdash;but it is quaint and characteristic
of the old man that this steep place should have stuck
in his mind and that all the salient features of the
new course should have slipped out. It seems as
if not even any of the points of the big rushes could
have stuck and gone back to Scotland with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after there came South from Scotland to the
Wimbledon Club another most perfect of Nature's
gentlemen, in Tom Dunn, of a great golfing family
and father of several fine professional players.</p>

<p>And now, with a club-house, though it was but an
iron hut, a resident professional and appointed times
of meeting, the Club was a live thing, and the complete
and final act of its lavish expenditure was to engage
a permanent green man&mdash;only one, but he had what
seemed the essential qualification of an education
as a miner in the Western States of America&mdash;an
excellent and entertaining fellow, Sowden by name,
a North Devonian by birth, with a considerable gift
of narrative and just about as much inclination to
work on the course and knowledge of his duties as these
antecedents would be likely to inspire in him.</p>

<p>While the Club was thus growing, my small body was
growing too; but the way of my growth, all through
life, has been rather that of an erratic powerful player,
falling continually into very bad bunkers of ill-health,
but making brilliant recoveries in the interims.
My father tried two schools for me, but I was invalided
home from both, and I expect it would have ended
in my escape from all education whatever if it had
not been that the United Services College was started
at Westward Ho! only two miles from our house.
But that was not till I reached the august age of fifteen
or thereabouts, by which time English golf had
developed largely. The first really fine English golfer
that we produced in the West of England was George
Gossett, son of the vicar of Northam. When the
big men came down from Scotland and from Blackheath,
to the meetings, they found a local golfer able to make
a match with the best of them. And hard after
him came Arthur Molesworth, a very fine player
even as a boy. I remember that while he was still
a Radley schoolboy, his father, the Captain, begged
a holiday for him to enable him to come and play
for the medal&mdash;I think he would have been about
sixteen at the time&mdash;and he came and won it, in a
field which included Sir Robert Hay and other well-known
players. There were three brothers of the
Molesworths, good golfers all, but Arthur, the youngest,
the best of the three. The two elder have been dead
for many years, but the father<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the youngest son
still live at Westward Ho!</p>

<p>At this time I had an elder brother at home, invalided
from his regiment in India. I was also assigned
an almost more valuable possession, in the shape of
an Exmoor pony which could jump like a grasshopper
and climb like a cat any of the big Devonshire banks
that it was unable to jump. So, in company with
this big brother and this small pony, I used to follow
the hounds over a country that seems specially designed
for the riding of a small boy on a pony; and in company
with the brother, the pony being left behind, I used
to go badger digging&mdash;my brother had a kennel
of terriers for the purpose&mdash;all over the countryside.</p>

<p>Of course it was a misspent youth. Of course I
was neglecting great opportunities, for to tell the truth
I greatly preferred the chase of the fox and the badger
at that period of life to the chase of the golf ball.
This sad fact should have been brought home to
me by a severe comment of my Uncle Fred on the
occasion of our playing for some prizes kindly given
for the juveniles by some of the elder golfers. As I
hit off from the first tee&mdash;all along the ground, if I
remember right&mdash;he observed sadly, "There's too much
fox and badger about his golf."</p>

<p>And so there was, but, for all that, I won a prize in
that competition. I think it was in the under twelve
class, for which I was just eligible by age, whereas
my only rival in the same class was a child of nine.
Therefore I returned in triumph with a brand-new
driver as a reward of merit&mdash;my first prize&mdash;and I
think it made me regard golf as a better game than
I had supposed it to be, for, after all, a driver is of
more practical use than a fox's brush, and this was
the highest award that the most daring riding could
gain for you. A boy's property is usually so limited
that any addition to it is of very large importance.</p>

<p>About a year later I began to take my golf with
gravity. The ball began to consent to allow itself to
be hit cleanly. A very great day came for me when
I beat my big brother on level terms. You see, he
had only played occasionally, at intervals in soldiering,
nor had he begun as a boy, whereas I had played,
even then, more than he, and had begun, in spite
of the wasted years, fairly early. I know I felt I
had done rather an appalling thing when I beat him;
I could not feel that it was right. But doubtless it
increased my self-respect as a golfer and my interest
in the game. The Blackheath visitors were very
kind to me, and used to take me into their games.
Of course I could not expect to be in such high company
as that of the George Glennies and the Buskins,
but Mr. Frank Gilbert, brother of Sir Frederick, the
artist, Mr. Peter Steel and many others invited me
now and then to play with them. I began to think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
myself something of a player. The most dreadful
event, most evil, no doubt, in its effect on my self-conceit,
happened when Mr. Dingwall Fordyce, who
was a player of the class that we might to-day describe
as "an indifferent scratch," asked me to play with
him. He offered&mdash;I had made no demand for odds&mdash;to
give me four strokes, and asked at what holes I
would have them. At that date, be it remembered,
there were no handicaps fixed by the card, nor were
the holes determined at which strokes were to be taken.
It was always at the option of the receiver of strokes
to name, before starting, the holes at which he would
take his strokes. I told Mr. Fordyce I would take
the four he offered at the four last holes. He said
nothing, though likely enough he thought a good
deal. What he ought to have done was to thrash me,
for an impertinent puppy, with his niblick; but what
he did, far too good-naturedly, was to come out and
play me at those strange terms, with the result that
I beat him by five up and four to play without using
any of the strokes at all! It was precisely what had
been in my mind to do when I took the strokes at those
last four holes, but I expect the reason I won was
that he was a little thrown off his balance by my
cheek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<h4>OF YOUNG TOMMY MORRIS AND OTHER
GREAT MEN</h4>


<p>My way down to the links, from our house, led
right through the village of Northam, wherein
Johnnie Allan, the professional, had set up his shop.
Now if there is anyone who, being a golfer, has not
appreciated the delight of the compound smell of
the club-maker's shop&mdash;the pitch, the shavings, the
glue, the leather and all the rest of the ingredients&mdash;if
anywhere there lives a golfer with nose so dead,
then I am very far indeed from thinking that words of
mine can excite him to a right appreciation of this
savour. But if not, if the reader has the truly appreciative
nose, then he will realize what a delight it was
to me to look in each morning on the way down
to golf to enjoy this, to exchange a word with Johnnie
Allan, to get something quite superfluous done to
a club, and if possible get my friend to come down
to the links with me. Often I would find him sitting
on his bench with a golf ball moulded, but not yet
nicked, turning it about with his fingers in the cup
designed for its holding, and hammering it with the
broad chisel end of his hammer made for the purpose.
This was in the days of hand-hammered balls, before
the mode had been invented of having the marking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
engraved on the mould so as to turn them out what
we then called "machine hammered."</p>

<p>In course of the walk down to the links, if I could
persuade him to be my companion, he used to tell
me tales of the great men in the North, of Old Tom
and Young Tommy, of Davie Strath and the rest
of them. He was a Prestwick man, and had come
from there to work in Old Tom's shop at St. Andrews
before he journeyed South. He had never done as
well as he would have liked in the championship, but
had twice won the first prize given by way of consolation
for those to play for who had not gained a place
in the prize-list in the championship proper. That
will indicate his class as a golfer as more than respectably
high. It was about this time that arrangements
were made for bringing down Young Tommy and
Bob Kirk to Westward Ho! (the place was now
thoroughly baptised with its new name), and they
played, with Johnnie Allan, a kind of triangular duel.</p>

<p>I well remember the immense excitement with
which I followed those matches. They did not play a
three ball match for the prizes offered, but a species
of American tournament in singles, and my delight
was huge when our local friend defeated the renowned
Tommy Morris. Then Tommy defeated Bob Kirk.
Now if our Johnnie could only beat Bob Kirk (as he
certainly would, we said, seeing that he had beaten
Morris who had beaten Kirk), why then he would
prove himself beyond denial best man of the three.
Unhappily the propositions of golf do not work themselves
out as logically as those of Euclid, though often
arriving at his conclusion "which is absurd," and
Bob Kirk had the better of our local hero most of
the way round. He was dormy one. Then, at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
last hole, came a great incident of golf which made
on me so deep an impression that in my mind's eye
I can see the whole scene even now. Coming to that
last hole&mdash;mark this, that our favourite hero was one
down, so that feeling ran high&mdash;Bob Kirk got his
ball on one of the high plateaux, with steep sand
cliffs, which at that date jutted out into the big bunker.
His ball lay just at the edge of the plateau, and on
its left verge, as we looked towards the hole, so that
to play it in the direction that he wanted to go it seemed
that he would have to stand eight feet below it, in the
bunker. And, he being a little round man, we chuckled
in glee and said to one another, "He's done now."
But what do you suppose that pernicious little Scot
did then? He went to his bag and selected a club&mdash;a
left-handed spoon! He had a couple of practice
swings with it. Then he, a right-handed man, addressed
himself to that ball left-handedly, and drove it,
if not any immense distance, at all events as far
as he needed in order to make morally sure of his half
of the hole, which was all that he, being dormy,
required. It was a great <i>tour de force</i>. It exacted
our grudging applause. We admired, but at the same
time we admired with suspicion. It was scarcely, as
we thought in the circumstances, a fair golf stroke.
It savoured of the conjuring trick if not of sheer
black magic.</p>

<p>Really, considered after this lapse of years which
allows cool reflection, it was a good piece of golf.
There are not many right-handed men who trouble
themselves to carry a left-handed club, even if they
have the ambidexterity to use it. In fact it is the
only stroke of its kind, played with a full swing in the
crisis of a match, that I have ever seen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Young Tommy paid us another visit in the West
not long after, and this time in company with his
own dearest foe at St. Andrews, Davie Strath.</p>

<p>So, even in the far West we were not without our
great examples, and Johnnie Allan himself was a
golfer well worth following. As the course then
started, out by the Pebble Ridge and at the present
third tee, we, coming from Northam, had to walk
out over the flatter part of the Burrows which the
first and second, and, again, the seventeenth and
eighteenth holes occupy now. That meant, of course,
that we would take a club with us and practise shots
as we went along; and since I so often had Johnnie
Allan as my companion on those walks, it would be
very hard for me to say how much of golfing skill
and wisdom I did not unconsciously pick up as we
went along and he watched me play the shots and
criticised them. I have never in my life been through
the solemn process of a set lesson with a professional,
but have no doubt that I assimilated wisdom in the
best, because the unconscious and the imitative, way,
in those walks and talks, varied by occasional precept
and example, with Johnnie Allan.</p>

<p>And by the same route came Captain Molesworth
and his three sons, but they, having further to go,
used to drive, the Captain generally manipulating
the reins in strictly professional style&mdash;as a sailor
clutches the rudder lines&mdash;and their carriage, going
at full speed of the horse, making very heavy weather
of it over the ruts and bumps, and only the sailor's
special providence ever bringing them safe to port
before the Iron Hut. There the Captain would tie
his horse, by a halter, to the wheel of the cart and
leave all to get itself into a tangle that only a nautical
hand could unravel, while all the world played golf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Sometimes we too would ride or drive, and I have in
mind a great occasion on which my brother, home
from India, and I were driving down in my sister's
donkey-cart. The cart broke down in Northam
village, so we left it there, in charge of the blacksmith,
to repair, while we proceeded on, both mounted on
the donkey. Now my brother was very much of
what at that time was called a "dandy"&mdash;since
"masher," and at the present moment "nut." He
was arrayed in Solomon-like glory of white flannel
trousers and red coat&mdash;for men did play golf in red
coats in those days. Now the donkey was a good
donkey and strong, but he knew how to kick, and
he thought no occasion could be better than when
he had two on his back and the central and fashionable
high street of Northam village for the arena. Therefore
he set to and quickly kicked us both off, I being
involved in my brother's d&eacute;bacle, and he, though
a very good man on a horse, not being accustomed to a
saddleless donkey. The glory of Solomon disposed
on the village streets was a splendid spectacle. But
we rose, nothing daunted, though with the glory a
little sullied, and, my brother then excogitating the
great thought that if we put his, the greater, weight
behind, with mine in front&mdash;it had been the other
way at our first essay&mdash;the donkey would then find
it the harder to lift its hindquarters for the act of
kicking, we disposed ourselves in that manner, and
the donkey, whether for mechanical reasons or because
he perceived that we were not going to let him off the
double burden, proceeded with the proverbial patience
of his kind and we reached the links without further
accident.</p>

<p>Mr. Gossett and his sons would be coming from the
other direction, from Westward Ho! for he gave up
the cure of Northam about this time and went to
live at Westward Ho! and with others coming on
the same line there would be a great re-union at the
Iron Hut before starting out on matches&mdash;a great
match-making too, for in those days we did not make
our matches very long beforehand, and such things as
handicap competitions were not known among us.
They were soon evolved, but the idea of any fixed
handicap, by which each man should know his value,
was not so much as thought of. Matches were made
by a process of stiff bargaining between the parties
concerned. "How much will you give me?" "A
third." "Oh, my dear fellow, I couldn't possibly
play you at less than a half!" The humility that
was displayed was most edifying. We had twice the
fun over our matches then, just because of this bargaining
and all the talents of Uriah Heap that it
brought into sharp prominence. One of the best of
the match makers, and one of the bravest, though very
far from the best of the golfers, was Captain Molesworth,
familiarly known to all and sundry as "the old Mole."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h4>THE SPREAD OF GOLFING IN ENGLAND</h4>


<p>It seems to me that the establishment of the Club at
Westward Ho! and the discovery that it was
possible to play golf, and the very best of golf, in
England, even as in Scotland, sent a new thrill of
life into all the dormant golfing energies of the country.
It stirred up the Blackheathens; then it led to the
institution of the Golf Club associated with the London
Scottish Volunteers, which was later to develop a
schism, of which one division became the Royal
Wimbledon Golf Club. The great man of the volunteers
was the still present Lord Wemyss,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> then Lord
Elcho, and he was as keen a golfer as rifle shot. To
us at Westward Ho! the Wimbledon Club sent down
Henry Lamb, Dr. Purves and many more; but
these two were perhaps their strongest. Of the
Blackheathens I have spoken, but I want to give a
special word to Mr. Frank Gilbert, both because he
was especially kind, of all the others, to me as a
boy and also because his gift of nomenclature survives
in the popular name still often ascribed to one of
the Westward Ho! holes. At times of excitement
his aspirates used to fly. He was perfectly aware of
it and did not in the least mind gentle chaff on the
subject. I even think he often sent them flying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>purposely, for sake of effect. After all, he used
just as many aspirates as anyone else, only that
he used them in rather different places: that was all.
The hole that his genius named was that which is
now the ninth, and its naming was on this wise:
after hacking his ball out of first one bunker, thence
into another, and from that into a third, he exclaimed
in accents of inspiration and despair, "I call this
'ole the halligator 'ole, because it's full of gaping jaws
waiting to devour you." Therefore the "halligator
'ole" it remained for many a year afterwards and is
so known to some even to this day. I remember
another exclamation of his that gave us purest joy
at the time, when, having made what he believed
to be a lovely shot over a brow to a "blind" hole
in a hollow he ran up to the top of the brae in exultation,
only to turn back with tragic dismay on his
face and on his lips the eloquent expostulation, "Oh,
'ell, they've haltered the 'ole." I used to play him
for a ball&mdash;a shilling gutta-percha ball&mdash;on the match,
and for a long while, when I was a boy, we were
fairly equal, and how often, towards the end of the
match, he would miss a short putt in order that he
might pay me the shilling, and not I him, I should
be sorry to say. I know it was pretty frequently.</p>

<p>And then this thrill of new golfing life started at
Westward Ho! communicated itself to the many
Scots established in Liverpool, so that in 1869 they
so far organised themselves as to institute that which
is now the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, playing at Hoylake.
What that meant for us at Westward Ho!
was that men of Hoylake came down to play matches
with our local heroes and to take part in our medal
competitions. There were Mr. John Dunn and Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
John Ball, the father of our many times champion.
Colonel Hegan Kennard was another who was associated
with the Hoylake club, though his association
with Blackheath was closer&mdash;of that venerable Club
he was Field Marshal for very many years. But
some of the first of the big matches, matches with
sums of money depending on their result which seemed
to me fabulous in days when a sixpence in the pocket
was a rare coin, were those which were planned by
the enterprise of Captain Molesworth&mdash;himself and
Johnnie Allan in partnership against Mr. John Dunn
and Jack Morris, who had come as professional to
Hoylake. Now John Dunn made very much more
show as a player than the old Mole. "The mole&mdash;an
animal that keeps to the ground" was a definition
which we used to be fond of quoting as we grew
out of the years of veneration to those of impertinence.
He had an absolute inability to drive the ball any
height in the air. No other man ever played golf
so cheaply as the old Mole: he had but three clubs,
sometimes profanely stigmatized as Faith, Hope and
Charity, a driving weapon of sorts, an iron and a
putter, which he carried himself, never taking a
caddie, and his ball was generally of the colour of a
coal from long and ill usage. But he would bet
you &pound;50 on a match if you cared about it, and would
play you with fine pluck to the very finish. He was
in fact a miserable driver; nor was there any "class"
or science at all about his iron play. But he would
shovel the ball along, and up to the green somehow or
other with his iron: he had a knack of getting there;
and when once on the green there was not nor ever
has been a better putter.</p>

<p>Now the man who has his wits about him, to per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ceive
what this description implies, will see that it
is the description of an uncommon good partner in
a foursome. And he was all the better partner on
account of the way in which the chances of any match
in prospect were likely to be reckoned; for John
Dunn might argue it out, "I can give Molesworth
a third," which he probably could, "and John Allan
cannot give Jack Morris a third," which he surely
could not, "therefore we have the best of it." That
looks logical, but it leaves out the important fact
that the Molesworth qualities were just those of most
value to a strong driver like Johnnie Allan, while
his short game and his pluck were clear assets to the
good. In fact he and Johnnie Allan used to get
round the course in scores that Allan himself would
not think amiss, and they had all the better of these
matches against the men of Hoylake.</p>

<p>The Hoylake men came to Westward Ho! and
Captain Molesworth took himself and his sons to
Hoylake. Arthur Molesworth won the medal there
when he was only a boy at school, and I remember
with awe and admiration hearing his father describe
how the boy had to sit beside the Mayor of Liverpool
at the Club dinner and of all the mighty honour
done him. And the present-day golfer should make
no mistake about it nor doubt that this Arthur Molesworth
was a very fine golfer. George Gossett beat
him, in a set match that they played, but I think
that Molesworth, who was several years younger,
was really the finer golfer. Certainly he had greater
power. He played in an ugly style, with a short
swing, but his driving was long and he could play
all his clubs. There were several years during which
he was certainly the best amateur golfer that England
had then produced, and I think he was better than
any in Scotland. A few years later he went far
towards proving it; but I will come to that story
in its place.</p>

<p>What I am trying to show for the moment is not
only a gallery of great players in the past, but also
the way in which the game was brought home to us
at Westward Ho! how golf gradually spread in England
and gathered in players, more Clubs being started,
and for how much the influence of Westward Ho!
and its golfers&mdash;of that most enterprising of all of
them, in particular, the old Mole&mdash;counted in the
diffusion of knowledge of the game. We were still,
of course, far from the era when a man could go about
travelling in England without causing quite a sensation
among those who saw his clubs. The Englishman,
as a rule, believed golf, if he had heard of it at all,
to be a game that was played on horseback. And
about that time, I being then sixteen years of age,
so that the year would be 1875, there happened
what made a bigger impression upon me than any
event that has ever occurred since&mdash;I won the bronze
scratch medal annually given by the club for competition
by boys under eighteen years of age. Having a
year to spare, of the age limit, I possibly might have
won it again the next year also, but by that time I
had done even greater things. I thought comparatively
little of that second medal; but, as for that first,
I gazed at it as if it were the Koh-i-noor, and certainly
should not have valued it as highly if it had been.
I can get some of that glamour back by gazing at
it now, but it is only a rather faint reflection. Still,
it gives far more comfort than the view of any other
trophy that I ever won in later years, and I am grateful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to the burglar who took all my gold medals some
years back that he regarded this thing of bronze as
beneath his notice. Arthur Molesworth must just
have crossed the age limit which put him out of the
play for this boys' medal; but there were a number
of boys there at that date, in the holidays&mdash;Brownes,
Burns, Roddy and Hugh Owen&mdash;there was quite
a big competition. It is very sad to think how many
of them are dead&mdash;Herbert Burn, the best player of
the lot, among them. But Charlie (now Colonel and
M.P.&mdash;he went into the Royals) was quite of the scratch
class at his best. But still the leaders of the golf
were older men: Henry Lamb, Dr. Purves, George
Glennie, Mr. Buskin, Mr. Adamson, Colonel Kennard,
Sir Robert Hay, Tom Oliphant. And I am sure there
are a great number of good men whom I have forgotten.
My Uncle Fred was only a little behind the best of
them, but he had by this time given up his house
at Westward Ho! and was living abroad, so he only
came down occasionally. There was a small local
contingent of very zealous golfers, men who never
missed their two rounds every week-day&mdash;we had no
Sunday golf.</p>

<p>Thus we bring down the story to a point at
which golf is really launched in England with a full
sail, and myself having a taste of just so much success
as to make me firmly believe henceforth, for some
years, that success in golf was the one thing worth
living and working for. I might still have a hankering
after the occasional fox and badger, to say nothing
of the rabbits, partridges and wild fowl; but these
began to seem only the relaxations, and golf the true
business of a well-spent life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE WEAPONS OF GOLF IN THE SEVENTIES</h4>


<p>You could not travel about with golf clubs in
the seventies without exciting the wonder and
almost the suspicions of all who saw such strange things.
I am not quite sure that you would not excite almost
equal wonder if you were to travel now with a set of
clubs such as we used then. In the seventies, and in
my own teens, I was laboriously, and with rigid economy,
working my way to the possession of a variety
of wooden clubs such as it would puzzle the modern
golfer even to name. There was the driver or play-club&mdash;that
is understood. Then there were the long
spoon, the mid-spoon and the short spoon: they
may be understood also. But then, besides, between
the driver and the long spoon, making such a nice
gradation that it was really hardly to be distinguished,
came what was called the "grass" or "grassed"
club. I hardly know which was the right name.
The idea, I think, was that, being almost of the
driver's length and suppleness, but with the face not
quite so vertical, it could be better used when the
ball was lying on the grass&mdash;not teed. At the same
time we used to talk of a club being "grassed" with
the technical meaning of having its face set back
a little. So I hardly know what the right nomenclature
was, nor does it matter. This "grassed"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
or "grass" club was rather a refinement: it was
only the golfer who was very determined to have
no gap in his armour that would carry it; but the
three spoons were almost <i>de rigueur</i>. No self-respecting
golfer could well be without them. It may surprise
the student of history not to find the "baffy" put
down in the list; but as a matter of fact the baffy
had passed out of common use by this date. A few
men of the old school, as Sir Robert Hay, continued
to play it to admiration, but the genius of young
Tommy Morris had already initiated a whole school of
disciples into the mode of approaching with iron clubs,
so that the baffy was out of vogue. The professionals
that came from the north to visit us at Westward
Ho! as well as our resident Johnnie Allan himself,
were all followers and exponents of the relatively
new mode of jabbing the ball up to the hole with the
iron clubs and with a great divot of turf sent hurtling
into the air after the ball. Thus the green was
approached; and up to just about the date of which
I am writing the subsequent operations of holing
out were always performed with a wooden putter.
There was also a weapon known as the driving putter,
which was just like the ordinary putter save that
its shaft was longer and more supple. It became,
in fact, very nearly a short shafted driver, and its
special purpose was to drive a low ball against the
wind when there was no bunker to carry. Of iron
clubs there were the cleek, the iron and the niblick.
It was even then possible to go into the niceties of
driving-iron and lofting-iron, but many a golfer
thought his set perfect and complete with a single iron,
for all purposes.</p>

<p>Now you will see, from this list, both what super<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>fluities
of wooden clubs it held, according to modern
notions, and also what essential instruments, to our
present thinking, were lacking. There was no such
club as a mashie. Young Tommy, ever an innovating
genius, is credited with being the first to use the
niblick for lofting approaches, but the niblick of those
days was peculiarly ill adapted to such delicate uses.
It was very small and very cup-shaped in its head.
The head was only a very little larger in diameter
than the ball. Therefore it required extreme accuracy
to hit the ball rightly with it and avoid that disastrous
error of "piping"&mdash;hitting the ball with the hose&mdash;of
which many of us have been many a time guilty
with clubs whose relative breadth and length of blade
make such error far less pardonable. The recognized
club for the approach stroke was the iron, the ordinary
"maid-of-all-work" iron, unless you were one of
those extra particular people who had two grades
of the iron. And another conspicuous absentee from
the list is the brassey. Such a club was not known,
but I can remember that about this day I became the
proud owner of a club just then coming into vogue
under the name of the wooden niblick. Its head,
made of wood, was very short, like that of the iron
niblick, for the purpose of fitting into ruts. It was
the original of the "brassey," for the idea of a rut
suggested the idea of a road. There were more roads
then than now, in proportion to the rest of the golfing
hazards in the world&mdash;as at Blackheath, Wimbledon,
and Musselburgh. And the purpose of the brass
on the club's sole was to protect it from the stones,
etc., of the road when used for play off such unfriendly
surface. The brassey was just the wooden niblick
with a sole of brass, and as all wooden niblicks began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to be brazen upon the sole their very name passed
into oblivion and that of brassey superseded it.</p>

<p>I have written here of all putters being of wood;
and so they were. But somewhere, at some time, some
inspired craftsman of the mystery of Tubal Cain
must have bethought him, even before this, of making
a putter of iron, for the following reason. In the
old Iron Hut at Westward Ho! on days when the
rain kept us in and the time hung heavy, we used
to solace its tedium by bringing out our clubs from
their lockers and trying to do a deal with each other,
whether by exchange or by sale and purchase, and
during one of these barterings an utterly unknown
weapon was brought out with the rest of his bundle,
by a young Scot of the name of Lamont, brother
of that Major Lamont as he now is, who until quite
lately lived at Westward Ho! and to whom I owe
a great deal of the golf that I picked up as a boy.
He was the Lamont of Ardlamont, the estate in
the Mull of Cantyre, which came into fame in consequence
of a certain notorious criminal prosecution
in the Scottish courts. The strange weapon which
this younger brother of his unearthed, on that day of
rain, was, though we hardly knew then how to name
it, an iron putter. It was inches deep in rust. Nevertheless,
as I handled it, I liked the feel of it. I gave
for it, in exchange, an old and much mended spoon,
and it was that iron putter which I have used for
forty years since, which has been copied countless
times, of which the replicas are in many hands and
many lands, and one copy of which, adorned and
glorified, used to lie, and may so lie still, for all I
know, on the table on the occasion of the dinners
of the Match Dining Club. At that first date of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
resurrection (Mr. Lamont could give no account of
how it came to his possession) it was greeted with
unhallowed laughter, and so too whenever I brought
it out to putt with it. But I used to be rather a
good putter as a boy, and that club is still the best
balanced (though its old shaft has been broken and
the new one is less good) that ever came out of a club-maker's
shop, and I soon changed those sounds of
derision at its appearance into a more respectful
form of greeting. That was the first iron putter ever
seen in the West, and I believe it to have been the
virtual parent of every iron putter that ever has
been seen since.</p>

<p>It was the wooden age of golf clubs, as of battleships,
and I hope the wood of our ships was better seasoned
than that of our clubs. Shafts, as a rule, were of
hickory then, as now, though we made strange experiments
of ash, of lance-wood, of green-heart and divers
species. For the hard balls of those days you had
to have a certain softness in the heads of the wooden
clubs which is not wanted with the resilient rubber-cored
balls. Beech was the wood for the heads,
though apple and other kinds were tried; but beech,
and of a soft quality at that, drove the most kindly.
And if a man were at all a hard hitter, and had a
fit of heeling or toeing, the head of the club was
sure very soon to show a crack across it, which would
spread wider at each successive mishit. And even
if you kept hitting the ball "dead centre" every time,
a hole in the club-face would gradually be worn out
by that repeated hitting, especially if the ground were
wet and the grass long. Then we used to go to
Johnnie Allan to have him put in a leather face, that
is to say a patch of leather where the face was worn;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and this would drive just as well, except it got sodden
with wet, as the original wood. So, with so many
of the clubs made of wood, and not always like the
butter used by the Mad Hatter for watch greasing,
the best wood, and the balls so hard and stony
of impact, it is no wonder that golf was rather an
expensive game for a boy whose shillings were not
many. Though the ball only cost a shilling, while
the modern ball costs half a crown, the club-smashing
abilities of the shilling's worth made it a much dearer
ball, to say nothing of the longer life of the half-crowner.
And just about this date they introduced a novelty
in the balls also&mdash;the "hammering," as we used
to call it, that is to say the nicking or marking of
the ball's surface, being done by indentations engraved
in the metal moulds in which the balls were cast.
This obviated all that labour of "hammering" the
nicks in by hand, which was the ancient fashion. Yet
it was some while before these "machine-hammered"
balls, as we called them, found general favour with
the golfing public, certain Conservatives asserting
that the "hammering" was essential to the right
tempering of the stuff of the ball, while others, like
that great little man Jamie Anderson, then at the top
of his game and fame, confessed, with a perfect
knowledge that the reason was only subjective, that
"he could na' strike" a machine-hammered ball.
He soon learned to strike it, however, as the further
course of golfing story sufficiently testified.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h4>HOW MEN OF WESTWARD HO! WENT
ADVENTURING IN THE NORTH</h4>


<p>In the year 1875, I having then arrived at the
advanced age of sixteen, and being admitted
as a member of the Royal North Devon Golf Club,
in the autumn committed the blazing indiscretion
of winning the scratch medal which carried with
it the Captaincy of the club. How glaring the indiscretion
was may be gathered from the fact that this
Captaincy, thus conferred, entailed the obligation of
taking the chair at the general meetings. I do not
know that I made a much bigger hash of it than
any other boy forced into the same unnatural position
would have done. It had not been contemplated,
apparently, that a schoolboy was likely to beat all
the reverend seniors, and one good effect was that
the regulation was altered, and winning this medal
did not much longer confer on a person who might
be the least fitted for it the function of presiding at
the meetings. But it had given to me a dignity
which could not be changed by legislation. At the
spring meeting of that very same year I had received
no less a handicap than twelve strokes, so I must
have been very much of that nuisance to the handicapper,
the "improving player." I became a "scratch
player," however, from the autumn of that year. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
those days, before handicaps were fixed, golfing society
was divided into two classes&mdash;those who were scratch,
and those who were not&mdash;and there was no idea of
such a thing as a penalty or <i>plus</i> handicap. Some
of the so-called "scratch" players of the day were
exceedingly scratchy ones, and only supported their
dignity at a considerable expense: there was one in
particular of whom it was said that it cost him three
hundred a year to be a scratch player or, that is
to say, to play all and sundry amateurs on level
terms.</p>

<p>Beside this event of my winning this medal, which
was no doubt an affair of more importance in my eyes
than in those of anyone else, the autumn of 1875
was big with great issues, under the management
of the enterprising "old Mole," who went up to
Scotland with his three sons in search of adventure
and with a great programme before them. Captain
Molesworth had been playing a good deal with Mr.
(later Sir) W.H. Houldsworth, and gave the challenge
that he would bring up his three sons and play Mr.
Houldsworth and any three Scots amateurs that
Mr. Houldsworth should choose in single matches,
the side that won the largest aggregate of holes to
be the winner of the stakes. Now the Mole had the
better of Mr. Houldsworth: that was really, though
no doubt tacitly, acknowledged on both sides. Arthur
Molesworth was likely to win his matches, no matter
who was brought against him. But George, the
second brother, though a brilliant player at times,
was very uncertain, and Reggie, the eldest, and slightly
lame, was the weakest vessel of the three. Say
that the Captain and Arthur should gain some holes,
it was the hope of Scotland that an equivalent number,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
at least, might be hammered out of the other two
brothers. Unfortunately for Scotland it was the
former part of the calculation which was realized
more fully than the latter. The matches were played
at St. Andrews and Prestwick. I think there is little
doubt that at that time, as indeed for many years,
Leslie Balfour (later Balfour-Melville) was the strongest
amateur player in Scotland; and at St. Andrews
Mr. Houldsworth's team was himself, Leslie Balfour,
Dr. Argyll Robertson and J. Ogilvie Fairlie. Arthur
Molesworth won two holes only (they were thirty-six
hole matches) off Leslie Balfour, and Argyll Robertson
took seven holes from George. But then Reggie
rather upset calculations by beating Ogilvie Fairlie
by two holes. Lastly came in the father of the
flock with nine holes to the good, and that settled it.
At Prestwick, Mr. Syme, a minister of the Kirk,
and Andy Stuart took the places of Dr. Robertson
and Leslie Balfour, and here Ogilvie Fairlie got back
his own with interest from Reggie Molesworth, winning
by seven holes, and Mr. Syme beat George by two,
but Arthur knocked six holes to the family credit
out of Andy Stuart and the Captain came in again
with his big balance&mdash;ten up on Mr. Houldsworth.</p>

<p>So they carried through that adventure with credit
and renown, and, I suppose, some profit, and then
later in the same year, Arthur Molesworth, with his
father as backer and henchman, went up to St. Andrews
again to do battle on his own account.</p>

<p>This adventure came about owing to an idea very
prevalent, though I hardly know whether it had
existence in fact, that Young Tommy had a standing
challenge open to back himself at odds of a third
against any amateur. Captain Molesworth took it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
up on behalf of Arthur, and to St. Andrews they
went again, in the dreary month of November, to
bring the matter to an issue. Altogether they played
for six whole days, two rounds a day, and all through
the piece Young Tommy had the better of it. I
cannot believe that in this match Arthur Molesworth
did himself full justice. It is true that during the
latter days snow lay on the ground, so that the greens
had to be swept and the game really was not golf
at all, but then it is no less true that Tommy held
the advantage just as consistently in the days when
real golf was to be played as on those when the snow
spoilt it. An onlooker did indeed tell me that
Young Tommy showed his skill wonderfully in lofting
off the snowy ground to the small circles that had
been swept round the holes. "Molesworth could
loft there just as well," he said, "but Tommy, using
his niblick, made the ball stay there as if it had a
string tied to it, whereas Molesworth's ball was always
running off on to the snow on the other side." But,
be that how it may, and crediting Young Tommy
Morris with a full measure of that genius for the
game which all who have seen him reported, I am not
going to believe that the golfer ever was born, be
his name Morris or that of any Triumvir, who could
give a third and a sound beating (for it was no less
than this that Young Tommy accomplished) to Arthur
Molesworth when he was playing his true game&mdash;and
this, with all due allowance made for Tommy's
knowledge of his home green. There was a peculiar
pathos attaching to that match and Young Tommy's
triumph, for it was his last. His wife had lately
died, and interest in life, even in golf, had gone out
for him. It was in November that he was thus beating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Arthur Molesworth, and on Christmas Day of the
same year he followed his young and loved wife.
His memorial, recording a few of his greater victories&mdash;he
was four times in succession open champion&mdash;is
in the St. Andrews' graveyard. Indisputable was
his genius for the game; impossible to calculate
is the comparison between his skill and power and
that of Harry Vardon, let us say, to-day. Doubtless
he was a far better putter, for while he was so good
at all points of the game he was at his strongest of
all on the green. I do not think we shall get a better
account than that which Leslie Balfour gave when
an Englishman asked him how he thought Young
Tommy would compare with the heroes of to-day.
Leslie thought a moment, and then he said, "Well, I
can't imagine anyone playing better than Tommy"&mdash;and
at that I think we had best leave it.</p>

<p>After that year Arthur Molesworth was not so much
at Westward Ho! He went to London, to an architect's
office, and at once begun to win medals at
Wimbledon, where Henry Lamb and Dr. Purves
were perhaps the best of the older men. The next
year some of them made a match for me to play him
at Westward Ho! and this was a great affair for me,
being the first "big match," as we called these set
encounters, for a money stake, that I ever had a hand
in. We started in a bad fright of each other, if I
remember right, and neither played his game, but
I had the fortune to get really going first and won
rather easily. About the same time Johnny Allan,
finding his work growing, had down his two young
brothers, Jamie and Mat, to join him in the club-making
and the playing. They brought in a new
element of interest, for even as a mere lad Jamie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Allan, in particular, was a wonderful golfer. He had
been there but a short while when Captain Molesworth,
always the enterprising spirit, issued a challenge on
his behalf to play any man in the world on four greens,
two rounds on each. Poor Young Tommy being
no more, Bob Kirk was the great man, for the time
being, at St. Andrews, and he was chosen as the
Scottish champion. The first part of the match was
played at Westward Ho! We hardly knew how young
Jamie Allan would carry himself, in this his first match
of importance, but he delighted us by showing that
faculty of rising to a great occasion without which
no golfer, however fine a player, can win fame. That
first round of his remains in my mind still as an
exhibition of just the most faultless golf I ever saw.
They said hard things about poor Bob Kirk afterwards
when he came up to Scotland, and especially to the
last stage, at St. Andrews, a beaten man. I believe
that in that last phase his play was contemptible.
But the Scottish critics, who were not there to see,
made a vast mistake when they said that he did not
play anything like his game all through the match.
What he did at Hoylake and at Prestwick, whither,
necessarily, they journeyed and golfed, I do not know,
but I do know that at Westward Ho! he played quite
a sound game. But a sound game was not enough
to give him a chance of standing up to the sample
of golf that Jamie Allan produced against him. Hole
after hole slipped away from him, just by a stroke
each, as they will when the one man is playing with
more than human accuracy. That was the story of
that match&mdash;it was won by Jamie's extraordinary golf
at the first encounter. But that is not the way in
which the Scotsmen have heard the story told.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h4>GOLF AT OXFORD</h4>


<p>When I went up to Oxford in the Christmas
term of 1878 I found that Royal and ancient
city sunk in an ignorance that is scarcely credible in
regard to all connected with the royal and ancient
game. I do not mean to say that golf was altogether
unknown. There was already a University Golf
Club in being, which I quickly joined, and we used
to play on the cricket fields in Cowley Marsh. That,
of course, implied that there was no golf in the summer
term when the marsh was occupied by the cricket.
But the golfers were very few. Mr. "Pat" Henderson
(now Wright-Henderson) the Wadham don, was one
of the most moving spirits. Then there was the
Principal of Hertford, there was Jim Lockhart, a fellow
of Hertford and a lecturer at my own college of Corpus,
and Lodge, then history lecturer at Brasenose. These
and a very few others of the dons used to play, and
of undergraduates the ones I best remember were
Cathcart of Christ Church, son of old Mr. "Bob"
Cathcart the Fifeshire laird and for very many a
year Convener of the Green Committee of the Royal
and Ancient Club, Baynes of Oriel, now a bishop,
Pearson of Balliol and several more. But their
doings were a black mystery to most of the undergraduates,
and either the game was not heard of by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
them or it was believed that the golfers practised
some unholy rite in the not very cheerful surroundings
of Cowley Marsh.</p>

<p>I had known Jim Lockhart before I went up, for
he was one of the Westward Ho! lot and a cousin
besides of Jack Lamont, to whom I owed very much
of my golfing education; so he saw to my election
to the Club as soon as I came to Oxford. Considering
the nature of the ground on Cowley Marsh, how
singularly well it was suited by its dreary name, and
that the only hazards were the cricket pavilions and
the occasional hedges, it is wonderful how much real
interest might be got out of the golf there. Whatever
else a cricket pavilion may be as a golfing hazard,
it is an uncompromising one. You have to be beyond
or to the side of it. If hard up against it, even the
strongest driver cannot send the ball through it;
and it gives occasion for pulling and slicing round
it which are good fun and good practice. Jim Lockhart
was a friend of my tutor at Corpus whom we
irreverently called "Billy Little," and it was on the
occasion of his taking his fellow don up to Cowley
to be introduced to golf that Little delivered himself
of the immortal definition of the game as "putting
little balls into little holes with instruments very
ill-adapted to the purpose." In later years I have
heard this brilliant definition attributed to Jowett.
It is thus that sayers of good things attract to themselves,
magnet-like, and increase their credit, with
many good things said by others.</p>

<p>At that time of day all who were golfers reared on
the seaside links had a very high and mighty contempt
for all in the shape of inland golf. In spite
of the antiquity of Blackheath, the art and labour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
by which an inland course can be brought up, when
the weather is favourable, to a condition almost rivalling
that of the seaside links were quite unknown.
One of the earliest founded of the inland type&mdash;of
course long ages after such an ancient institution
as Blackheath&mdash;was the course at Crookham, near
Newbury; and thereby hangs a tale of tragedy and
comedy commingled, associated with my golfing days
at Oxford. There was a certain trophy, open to all
amateur golfers, given by the Club, and called the
Crookham Cup. The conditions were that it was to
remain as a challenge prize to be played for annually
unless and until any man should win it thrice: in
which case it should become his property. Poor
Herbert Burn, who met his death not so very long
after in a steeplechase, had won this cup twice, and I
was invited to go to Crookham to see if I could put
a check on his victory and keep the cup for the Club.
We were hospitably put up for the meeting by Mr.
Stephens, the banker, at his place near Reading.
I had the luck to win the cup, and again, going down
the next year, won it again. If I should win it a
third time it became my very own, and, strong in
the zeal of pot-hunting, I went down the third year
too. I remember that on this occasion, for some
reason, Mr. Stephens did not act host for the meeting,
but Captain Ashton and I stayed with Major Charley
Welman at a little house he had near the course;
and what fixed the visit very firmly in my mind is
that Ashton and I returned to the house, after a
round on the first day of our arrival, with "dubbed,"
not blacked, golfing boots. It appeared that there
was no "dubbing" in the house, for the next morning
our boots were sent up to us black-leaded&mdash;with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
stuff that grates, I think, are done with. The effect
was splendid. We went forth quite argentine as
to our understandings, like knights in armour clad,
and, thus glistening, I contrived to win that cup for
the third and final time, which made it my own.
Now we come to the tragi-comedy of the story. On
the way back to Oxford there was the inevitable change
and wait at Didcot Junction, and there whom should
I see, with golf clubs under arm, but George Gossett?
He was then living at Abingdon. I greeted him
and asked with interest where he was going.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "there's a cup to be played for
at Crookham, near Newbury, to-morrow. I've won
it twice and I'm going down to see if I can win it
again, because if I do I keep it."</p>

<p>"Oh dear," I had to reply, "I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid you must have made a mistake in the day.
It's to-day it was played for, and what's more I'd
won it twice before, too, and I won it again to-day,
so that it's mine now, I'm afraid," and I opened its
case, which I had in my hand, and showed it to him.
I was obliged to tell him; for it would have been
worse still if he'd gone on all the way to Crookham
to find he was a day behind the fair. As it was,
it was comedy for me, but rather cruel tragedy for
him. No man ever took a knock more pleasantly:
he was the first to start a laugh against himself and
to give me congratulations, and express gratitude
for being saved the journey to Crookham. So he
took train to Abingdon and I to Oxford, and shortly
after, whether as the effect or no of this blow, he
went out to New Zealand, where he won the championship
of that country more than once.</p>

<p>What used to astonish all my friends in College<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
almost more than anything else, when I used vainly
to try to describe to them what manner of game
golf is, was the fact that I did not "dress" for it.
"Undress" is rather what they meant. You see,
they were accustomed to cricket, where you flannelled
yourself, and to football, rowing and athletic sports
wherein the mode of dress was to have as little of
it as might decently be, and that one should go forth
in the very clothes in which you might attend a lecture
and play a game in them seemed hardly thinkable.
They used to take up the clubs and regard them
curiously. They began to think there must be something
more than they had supposed in the game when
I showed them the Crookham Cup. They wanted
to see how it was done. The quad of a small College
like Corpus makes rather a small golf course. The
only way was to tee the ball well up and flog it out
over the College buildings into Christchurch Meadows,
or wherever else it might choose to fall. Occasionally
we used to try to astonish Merton by a bombardment.
But it meant a lavish expenditure of golf balls, for
there was no prospect of getting any of them back
again. The best possible tee to use, if you are driving,
or ironing, off a hard surface like a quad, is a clothes
brush. It hoists the ball well off the ground, so that
you can do anything you like with it&mdash;that is, always
supposing you have had the blessing of a sound golfing
education. But there was not one of my friends of
Corpus who had enjoyed this blessing. On the other
hand, it appeared to them a very simple matter to
hit a ball thus standing still: some of them were quite
skilful at the job of hitting balls in quick movement at
various games. So of course I must give them the club
and they must have a hit at the ball too. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
were humiliated to find how possible it was to miss
it altogether, but infinitely terrified at the result when
they did happen to hit. The quadrangle was inadequate
as a golf links. Nevertheless it was of more
than ample size as a racquet court. Yet that golf
ball, stoutly, if unscientifically, propelled, would fly
round those old grey walls, rebounding from one to
other with a terrific force and pace. Finally its career
would generally terminate by a crash through somebody's
window or a resounding knock on the President's
door, after which the golf meeting broke up, like a
dispersing covey, and disappeared till any suspicions
aroused by the outrage were calmed down.</p>

<p>About the middle of my time at Oxford we had
a mighty accession to our golfing strength in "Andy"
Stuart. He came up to Christ Church, and took part
with me, not very gloriously as I am able to remember,
in the first Inter-University match against Cambridge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h4>THE START OF THE OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE
GOLF MATCHES</h4>


<p>The institution of the Inter-University Golf Match
was due to the genius (which we will define in
this instance as the zeal and enterprise) of one of
the very finest putters that ever put a ball into a
hole, Mr. W.T. Linskill. Linskill was the inspiration
of the golf at Cambridge, and he did a great deal more
than any of us at Oxford to get the Oxford and Cambridge
Golf Match going. We only followed. And
it "went," in a very small fashion at first. I remember
it all now&mdash;the start in an early dawn from Oxford,
a long journey to London, then a long drive from Paddington
to Waterloo, then train to Putney, then
drive up to the London Scottish Iron Hut&mdash;some
luncheon there, and then a round of golf. In that
single round the golfing fortunes of Oxford v. Cambridge
for the year were decided. It was not altogether
satisfactory; especially as we had to do the journey
all over again, the reverse way, and had to get back
to Oxford the same night. It may well seem a question
to-day whether it was worth going through so
much for the sake of so little&mdash;as Mr. Weller said in
respect of marrying a widow&mdash;but still it was, at all
events, a start.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that so far as some of us of Oxford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
were concerned it was a very good start. I think
that "on paper," as is said, we had by far the better
of it. I forget all the team, but I know we started
with Andy Stuart and myself and I also think I
know that neither of us had any idea we were going
to be beaten by anything that Cambridge would
bring against us. The others were all good fighting
men, and should at least hold their own. In the event,
as for myself, I was not only beaten&mdash;by Mr. Paterson,
whom I regret that I have never met since&mdash;but
beaten rather disgracefully, for I was several holes
up&mdash;I think three&mdash;with only five to play and lost
every one of the remaining five. Then as to Andy
Stuart: he had to play Linskill, and I suppose that
at St. Andrews, where both were practically at home,
Andy would have given him a half&mdash;certainly a third
would not have brought them together&mdash;for though
Linskill was just about the best putter I ever saw,
the rest of his game was not very formidable. They
arrived at the last hole just before the Iron Hut&mdash;I
can see the scene now in my mind&mdash;all even, and
Linskill had the better of the hole. He was dead
and Andy had quite a doubtful putt to halve the
match, and I can remember a doubt arising in my
own mind as to whether I wished him to hole it or not.
Of course I did not want to see another match lost
to Oxford, as well as my own; but still, if the news
should have to go to St. Andrews that Andy had
been beaten by Linskill, level, it would be such a
fine joke that it was almost worth the lost match.
However he holed that putt with the courage of a
lion&mdash;he was always a good putter at the last putt
of a match&mdash;and so the match was halved. The
fortunes of the rest of the team were vastly better.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
On the whole, as I see by the record, Oxford won by
twenty-four holes on balance, on that first encounter,
so our evil deeds did no great harm. This was in
the autumn of 1878.</p>

<p>Next year the match was played again at Wimbledon.
Indeed, it is not very evident where else it
should have been played, unless perhaps at Blackheath.
There was in existence that course at Crookham,
near Newbury, which would have been convenient
to us, from Oxford; but it would not at all so well
have suited the Cambridge men. Besides there was
little play on it except at the meeting times, and
the course was not permanently kept in any order.
It is worth mentioning that for one of the holes,
a short hole, the play was over an avenue of tall trees.
In the years since, while inland courses have been
multiplying, so too have the tree hazards; but they
are generally brought in as flanking hazards, at the
sides. Here we had them in a line right across the
course, and you had to be over. It was not a "blind"
hole, for you could just get a glimpse of the flag
between the stems. Some of our course constructors
might make a note of this hole; and might do worse
than copy it. At the same time, I should say that one
of its kind, in a round, would be enough. I see
that this Crookham is given rank in Nisbet's <i>Golf
Year Book</i> as the "third oldest course" in England,
but I do not know whether we can allow it such
a venerable claim as that, remembering Blackheath,
Westward Ho! Wimbledon and Hoylake, to say
nothing of the old Manchester Golf Club which carries
its history back to 1818. But I am not sure but
what the history of this last has its breaks in continuity,
its silent places.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>The Oxford and Cambridge match continued to
be played at Wimbledon right up to 1896. I have
some recollection of the second match of the series,
in 1879. We started it, I think, from the Wimbledon
end, not the Putney end of the common. For my
own part I did better than in the first year, beating Mr.
Welch, who afterwards was a mathematical don at
Cambridge and used to keep the record and the medals
at Macrihanish in his pocket for many years. I
much regret that I never encountered him again,
any more than my opponent of the first year of the
match. On the whole transaction in 1879, Cambridge
beat us by ten holes, and yet we had some good men.
There was Archie Paterson, who was President of
the Boat Club afterwards, A.O. Mackenzie, who was
also in the 'Varsity boat, and, I think, Sir Ludovic
Grant, now a professor at Edinburgh University and
Captain in 1912 of the Royal and Ancient Club.
Ernest Lehmann, who writes so well and pleasantly
about the game, was a member of the Cambridge team
that year.</p>

<p>I have no recollection whatever of the 1880 match,
nor even whether I took part. I may have been ill
or in the Schools or doing something equally foolish,
but I see that Oxford won that year by eight holes.
In 1881, for no reason that I can remember, no match
was played&mdash;and that was the end of me as an Oxford
undergraduate golfer. I had passed the last bunker
and taken my degree before the next year's match.</p>

<p>All this while the only golfing playground at Oxford
was still the cricket grounds on Cowley Marsh, and
still there was no play at all in the summer term,
when the cricketers occupied the ground. But a few
years later some of us were asked to go up and take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
part in an informal kind of Past <i>v.</i> Present match,
more or less to celebrate the fact of the Club taking
occupation of new ground in Mr. Murrell's park, on
Headington Hill. Andy Stuart and I went up,
among others. We found the course rather pleasant,
in its inland way, with hedges for the chief hazards
and undulating gradients that formed rather a blessed
change from the sheer flatness of Cowley Marsh.
And what the match was that we played, or its result,
I do not in the least remember, but one remark of
a distinguished lady in the gallery I very well recollect&mdash;for
it was retailed with great joy to Andy and me
by one who overheard it&mdash;"Those men," she said,
indicating him and me, "are very nicely dressed&mdash;for
professionals."</p>

<p>That is the kind of compliment one really does
appreciate, because it is of the sort that is so rarely
paid. I speak for myself, only, in this: Andy Stuart
was always most careful in his attire, so as to merit
such appreciation frequently, and doubtless may
have received it often. Of course it would be impossible
even for a lady of the kindest heart and most
flattering tongue to pay such an encomium now. The
professionals are by far the most smartly clad of all
golfers. It was not so much so then.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I have given the impression
that the golf was very good at Oxford. It is rather
a mistaken impression, if I have conveyed it. On
the other hand, Oxford University was not a bad
place for the golfer. It had the large merit that its
vacations were long. Then I would go home to
Wellesbourne and play golf from there, at Westward
Ho! all day and every day, and it was during my
time at Oxford that there came to Wellesbourne as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
"odd boy"&mdash;that is to say, to do certain odd jobs
in the morning&mdash;a little, singularly white-flaxen-haired
boy from Northam village. It may seem surprising
that the coming of such a little boy to Wellesbourne
should be worthy of a place in this grave page of
golfing history, and I do not know exactly what
the duties of an "odd boy" are, but you may be very
certain that he performed them very efficiently when
I tell you that his name was John Henry Taylor.
He used to do these odd jobs, whatever they were,
like a champion, I am very sure, and then he used to
go down to the links and carry my clubs for me whenever
I was at home. The pay of a caddie at Westward
Ho! in those days was not exorbitant&mdash;sixpence
a round, and a hard walking and sandy round too,
of eighteen holes; and they had to walk down a
mile and a half from Northam village to begin to earn
it. But all wages were low and all living was cheap
in North Devon at that date and the boys were glad
to earn it, particularly with a bottle of ginger beer
generally thrown in of the royal bounty of the employer.
On occasions, and for valid consideration, they would
develop a spirit of independence which made money
seem no object, as in the instance, which has become
historic, of the small boy throwing down, in the middle
of the round, the clubs of his master, a gallant general
officer, and making his way without a word across the
Burrows. "Where are you going, boy?" the irate
man of war shouted after him. "I be goin' 'ome,"
came the firm reply. "There be goose for dinner."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<h4>GOLFING PILGRIMAGES</h4>


<p>It is a singular thing that not a seaside course
was designed, or opened for play, in the decade
from 1870 to 1880. I, at least, cannot remember
nor can find record of any such institution. In 1880
the Felixstowe Club was started. I have a vivid
recollection of my first visit to it, for I tried the wrong
line of approach, going to Harwich, which left the
whole of the river estuary to be crossed before Felixstowe
could be reached. It was late in the evening,
the ferry had stopped running, but I got myself and
portmanteau and clubs put across in a row-boat.
The mariner landed me on the far side in the gathering
dusk, got into his boat and commenced to row away
home again. "But," I said, as he moved off, "how
far is it to the hotel?" "About two miles," he answered,
resting on his oars. "But how am I to get there?"
I asked. "I don't know," he said; and then rowed
away. I sat in the fast increasing gloom on my portmanteau,
and wondered. Then I saw the light of a
providentially sent farm cart in the distance. I
hailed it. The carter was a kindly man, and in due
time I arrived at the Bath Hotel. Felixstowe course
was of nine holes only, if memory is a true servant,
at that date, and the club-house was that Martello
tower which even now comes in as something of a
hazard. So this was the third of the English seaside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
courses. In 1882 four more were added, Minehead,
Hayling Island, Bembridge and Great Yarmouth.
Therefore, by the time I left Oxford there was already
that beginning of the chain of links around the island
which has now been riveted so close. Coming
South, down the West coast of England, there was
Hoylake, a far cry from there brought you to Minehead,
then Westward Ho! thence round the Land's
End and the South Coast till you came to Hayling
Island and Bembridge, then Felixstowe and up the
East Coast to Great Yarmouth. The golfing plot is
thickening.</p>

<p>Bembridge had always a charming little course,
though crossing like a cat's cradle in places and more
dangerous than most battles when there were many
players. I gave dire offence there by writing that
after my first tee shot, which was heavily pulled on to
the seashore, the ball was at length found inside
a dead and derelict dog&mdash;emphatically a bad lie!
But there was not more than the licence almost permissible
taken in this account: the ball actually was very
near a dead dog; and why should there be offence
in the suggestion? It was not implied that it was
part of the duty of the Bembridge green committee
to scavenge the seashore. However, the dog has
been washed away now, and, I hope, the offence
also.</p>

<p>But the chain of links did not stop, northward, at
Great Yarmouth. As long ago as 1869 a nine-hole
course had been made and a Club started at Alnmouth,
only a little South of the Border. I believe
it will surprise most people to know that there was
this girdle of links thus early&mdash;in 1882&mdash;although the
gaps were long and many.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>An Oxford education is all very well, but it does
considerably interfere with the whole-souled attention
that a man ought to apply to golf. Nevertheless it
has the aforesaid merit that the vacations give leisure
for many a golfing pilgrimage, and it was in course
of these pilgrimages that I made acquaintance with
most of the English sea-links, as they came into being.
It was in 1879 that I paid my first visit to Hoylake.
Several of us went there from Westward Ho! to the
autumn meeting. There was much going to and fro
between golfers of Westward Ho! and Hoylake, and
indeed of Scotland too, at this time. So much was
this the case that in arranging the dates of the spring
and autumn meetings we used always to have a care
that they did not clash, and it was usually contrived
that the Hoylake meetings should fall sandwich-wise
between those of St. Andrews and of Westward Ho!
so that Scottish golfers might work South and take
Hoylake on their way to Westward Ho! The golfing
population of the day was not a very large one, but
it was very friendly. All, with few exceptions, knew
each other. Moreover, partly because they were a
small brotherhood, there was more <i>camaraderie</i> amongst
them than there is now, and a term in common use
then "the Freemasonry among golfers" had its
meaning. At that time if you met a man in the train
or waiting at a station with golf clubs, you would
be sure to say to him, "I see you are a golfer," and
he would respond with a glad pleasure, saying, "Yes&mdash;are
you?" and you would begin comparing notes.
To meet a fellow golfer was something analogous to
the meeting between Stanley and Doctor Livingstone
in the heart of Africa. It was a date at which such
white men as golfers were rare.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Going to Hoylake, therefore, we were sure of finding
ourselves among friends. I think there were at that
time, at Hoylake, in pilgrimage from Westward Ho!
besides myself, Captain Ashton, a sound golfer of
the second class, Major Hopkins, the golfing artist,
Captain Logan White, most amusing and caustic-tongued
of companions. The native people showed
us no little kindness. Only a short while before I
had taken part in a match at Westward Ho! got up
by the never-failing keenness of Captain Molesworth&mdash;he
and I against John Dunn, a famous man at
Hoylake (there is a hole named after him there to-day)
and Jack Morris. We had won that match handsomely,
but there was no scrap of ill-feeling. Then
there was Kennard there&mdash;Colonel Hegan Kennard&mdash;ever
most courteous, and arrayed with beautiful
neatness; a player of great neatness besides, and
winner of many scratch medals. There were also
three generations of John Ball at the Royal Hotel,
and already the youngest of the team was of great
local repute and of such skill that his father would
often issue the proud challenge to the company
assembled in the bar-parlour of the hotel: "I and my
son'll play any two." But those two were not very
eager in coming forward. The rooms of the Royal
Liverpool Club were in those days under the same roof
as the Royal Hotel itself and the course started with
what is now the eighteenth hole. Argyll Robertson
was there, from Scotland, a first-class golfer, and
surely the finest advertisement of his own profession,
which was that of oculist, that ever was seen, for
he was a singularly handsome man altogether, but
the most striking feature of his fine looks was an
eye more eagle-like than I ever saw in any other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
human face. There was also another little Scot of
very different aspect, short, rather round-about with
sloping shoulders like a champagne bottle, yet a
terrible golfer and a thrice-champion&mdash;Jamie Anderson.
Him I knew, he had been down to Westward
Ho! taking part against Jamie Allan in a campaign
of revenge for that defeat which the latter had put
upon Scotland (for we looked on Jamie Allan's golf
as wholly English) and on the man whom Scotland
had previously pitted against him, Bob Kirk. Jamie
Anderson, playing him on the same four greens of
St. Andrews, Prestwick, Hoylake and Westward
Ho! had defeated him&mdash;not heavily, but sufficiently.
But Jamie Allan at that time was not playing as he
had played against Bob Kirk. It was a fine game
enough, but it had not the same force and sting. I
had even enjoyed the honour of playing a foursome
at Westward Ho! with Jamie Anderson, and had
wrung from him a compliment which pleased me more
than a little, for at one hole I had pitched up a long
iron shot with some cut on it, and a happy chance
decreed that the ball should stop about six inches from
the hole. All Jamie said to me at the moment was
"Ah&mdash;that's the sort that saves a lot of trouble;"
but afterwards he had counselled me, "You should
come up to St. Andrews: they shots of yours that
pitch sae deid are just what's wanted there."</p>

<p>I quote that saying principally for the sake of my
own greater glory, but secondarily because it is noteworthy
as a comment on the St. Andrews of that
day, for if there is a quality of St. Andrews now
which is eminent above others it is that which puts
value not on the pitched, but on the running up
approach. It may be noted that this was all before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the introduction of the mashie and while the use of
the niblick for the approach was still looked on as a
<i>tour de force</i>. We did all that work with a broad
bladed iron.</p>

<p>Jamie Anderson walked round with Ashton and
myself when we played for the Kennard medal at
Hoylake on that occasion. I played fairly well and
won it with a score which was then good&mdash;I am not
sure it did not make a competition record&mdash;of 83.
Jamie was very friendly, though he did not say much
all the way round, but I was told that afterwards
he had remarked to somebody about my play that
"It's a fine game, but it's no gowf." I think I know
what he meant by the dubious compliment. In
those youthful days my great idea was to hit as hard as
ever I was able: the result was numerous mistakes
which were sometimes sufficiently redeemed, when
fortune favoured, by recoveries. Jamie Anderson's
theory of the game was very different. He never
put anything like his full power into the shot, but he
was so desperately accurate that Mr. Everard has
it on the record that the little man (and he was anything
rather than a boaster) once told him that he
had played ninety holes successively without a shot
that was not played as he intended it to be played.
Quite certainly, if that and that only was golf, it
was not golf that I played.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<h4>WESTWARD HO! HOYLAKE AND ST.
ANDREWS IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES</h4>


<p>In 1882 I left Oxford, with the intention of reading
for the Bar, and actually did go so far as to
eat a number of Inner Temple dinners at the extraordinary
hour of six o'clock. I do not think they
are quite digested yet. I had been suffering from a
series of severe headaches all through my last year
at Oxford and perhaps the dinners put a finishing
touch on them. At all events the doctors advised
me to give up all reading for a time&mdash;an instruction
which I have observed rather faithfully up to the
present. Their very wise counsel gave me all the
more time for golf&mdash;the rules were not quite so many
and headachy then and a man could play golf, or so
it seems to me, with a lighter heart. Perhaps it is
only because the heart had less weight of years to
carry on it then, but it strikes me that the game
and its players had more humour. I do not mean
that they were more witty; but greatly because
they were so immensely serious and solemn and earnest
they were more amusing. Their tempers were more
tempestuous, their language was infinitely more picturesque.
At Westward Ho! I am inclined to think
that there were some with special gifts of the kind.
We had many old Indian officers, with livers a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
touched, and manners acquired in a course of years
of dealing with the mild Hindoo, and because the
golf ball would not obey their wishes with the same
docility as the obedient Oriental, they addressed
it with many strange British words which I delighted
to hear and yet stranger words in Hindustani, which
I much regretted not to understand. But a sight
that has been seen at Westward Ho! is that of a gallant
Colonel stripping himself to the state in which Nature
gave him to an admiring world, picking his way
daintily with unshod feet over the great boulders of
the Pebble Ridge, and when he came to the sea,
wading out as far as possible, and hurling forth, one
after the other, beyond the line of the furthest breakers
the whole set of his offending golf clubs. That the
waves and the tide were sure to bring them in again,
to the delight of the salvaging caddies, made no
matter to him. From him they were gone for ever
and his soul was at rest.</p>

<p>Of course he bought a new set on the morrow, so
it was all good for trade and Johnny Allan. It also
afforded a splendid spectacle to an admiring gallery.
Really we have lost much at Westward Ho! even if
we have gained much, by the bringing of the Clubhouse
across the common. It was delightful, after
golf or between the rounds, to bathe off that Ridge,
or sit on it and watch the sea tumbling.</p>

<p>There were more "characters" in the golfing world
in those days. Who is there now like the Chieftain
at Hoylake or like Mr. Wolfe-Murray and many
more at St. Andrews? But Hoylake, more than the
others, had its humorists not so strictly of the unconscious
type. There was great fun in the musical
evenings in the Bar Parlour of the Royal Hotel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>&mdash;bar parlour sounds a little ominous, but I never
remember seeing a man in it who could not talk
straight nor walk straight out of it&mdash;and some of
the golfers had great voices. Tom Potter, well-known
with the Free Foresters' Cricket Club, was honorary-secretary
of the Club, then and for many a year, and
he was a fine singer. There was "Pendulum"
Brown, singing about "The Farmer's Boy," and
ever so many more; and these evenings were the
occasions for great match-making. Mr. Brown, nicknamed
Pendulum, by reason of something clocklike
about his swing, on one night, unlighted, so far
as I remember, by a moon, but with some stars in
the sky, backed himself to play the five holes round
the field, then and there, in an average, I believe it
was, of fives. Whatever the bet was, I know he won
it easily, and also that he did those five holes in several
strokes less than he took for them in the competition,
played in broad daylight, the next day. The only
stipulation he made with the gallery that turned
out to see this nocturnal performance was that they
should be silent for a moment after he drove off,
so that he might hear the ball pitch. The night was
very still and he seemed to get the place of the ball
with wonderful precision by the sound of its fall.
I know that his putting was extraordinarily good&mdash;far
better than an averagely good putter's daylight
putting.</p>

<p>There were many mirth-makers at Hoylake, besides
the song-makers. Of this number were Alec Sinclair,
with a fund of anecdote that never failed and was
very seldom guilty of vain repetition; George Dunlop,
bubbling over with wit and always ready to make
a good after-dinner speech, and a crowd more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>At St. Andrews the fun of the fair was less hilarious;
there was less noise about it; but there were some
witty and many amusing people. My first host
there, Logan White, was the very best of company
in himself; there were George Young and Mr. Hodges
of a most sardonic humour, and very many with
that sly and dry sense of fun which the Scot calls
specifically "pawky."</p>

<p>Also, there was Old Tom Morris&mdash;"born in the
purple of equable temper and courtesy," as Lord
Moncrieffe, I think it is, well describes him. It would
be a mistake to picture Old Tom as a witty man, or
even as a clever man, unless a tact and temper that
never fail be the very best kind of cleverness. But
we do not find any very witty or pungent sayings
attributed to Old Tom. It was his rich nature, with
its perfect kindliness and charity, that made him
so lovable, and such a valuable possession to St.
Andrews in reconciling the golfing interests, which
ran with counter currents, of the Town and of the
Club. As a peacemaker he had no equal. I, deeming
myself wronged by some infringement of golfing
rule or etiquette on part of another, might go to Tom&mdash;would
go to him as a matter of natural course&mdash;and
pour out my woes. He would listen with a
charming smile in his old eyes under their bushily
arching grey eye-brows, and when I had done he
would take his pipe out of his mouth and say, "Ou
aye." That was all, but it was enough to convince
of his perfect sympathy. Then, from the big window
of the club, or from Logan White's house on the
links, I would see that wicked man, my late opponent,
go up to the old man&mdash;for the scene was always that
eighteenth green, just before Tom's house, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
he would usually stand and smoke his old clay pipe
after his two daily rounds were played&mdash;and there
I would see exactly the same smile of sympathy for
my opponent's recounting of his woes likewise, and
at the end the pipe being withdrawn from the mouth;
and I might know, though I might not hear, that
precisely the same two words were being given for
his sufficient consolation likewise&mdash;"Ou aye." So
we both went away from him greatly comforted and
in a disposition to make it all up again before the
sun should go down on our wrath.</p>

<p>Old Tom was good enough to give me his friendship
from the very first moment I came to St. Andrews,
prompted thereto, as I think, largely by a comment
that one or two of the old stagers made to him that
my style was not unlike young Tommy's. I am
sure that even at that time this must have been a
comparison not quite just to that great young player
of old, for although it is more than likely that I have
cherished very many illusions in regard to my golf,
I am quite sure that I have never been so deluded
as to deem my style either good or graceful. But
the criticism was endorsed by Tom and gave me a
place in his heart. There was another point in which
he gave me praise (he could give no higher) for a
likeness to his talented lost son:&mdash;"Ye're like Tammie&mdash;ye'll
tak' a' as much pains over a short putt as a
long yin." Anything that had to do with a short
putt touched the dear old man in a very sensitive
place, for he was the worst short putter, for a great
golfer, that ever was. It is known that Mr. Wolfe-Murray
once addressed a letter to him, when on a
visit to Prestwick, "The Misser of Short Putts, Prestwick,"
and the postman carried it straight to Tom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
His own way was, in his sheer terror of missing the
putt, to get done with it as quickly as possible, and
often he would just go up to the ball and hit it in a
nervous hurry, without looking at the line at all,
so that he hardly gave himself a ghost of a chance
of holing. He had a way, too, of dragging back the
ball, with a quick movement of his putter, the moment
it had missed the hole, to try the putt over again,
and this habit had such possession of him, that I am
quite certain I have often seen him snatch the ball back
long before it came to the hole at all, and even, sometimes,
when it would have gone in had he not done so.
Once, but once only, I saw him beat his putter on
the ground so hard after a missed putt that the shaft
broke. I think it must have been sprung before,
for he did not really give it such a very severe strain,
but of course that was quite overlooked, and the joke
served for many a day to tease the old man with&mdash;as
"Tom, what is this I hear? Getting in such a rage
that you're breaking all your clubs! Awful!" The
poor old man would smile despairingly and generally
solace himself with some quotation from his dearly
loved poet Burns. "Scotland wi' a' thy faults I
lo'e thee still" was his most favourite text for consolation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h4>FIRST DAYS AT ST. ANDREWS</h4>


<p>I have always had, and always shall retain, a
very lively and grateful recollection of the kindness
with which all the local members of the Royal
and Ancient Golf Club and others at St. Andrews
received me when I first went up there, a Sassenach
among the Scots. I was very fortunate in my host,
Logan White, and found there also others that I
had known in the South, Harry Everard, most keen
of golfers and best of all judges of the game, Victor
Brooke, most eager, most charming and most Irish
of Irishmen, and many others who had been old
friends of my boyhood at Westward Ho! Besides,
there were many who retained a memory and an
affection for my Uncle Fred, whose locker, with his
name upon it, was still in the big room. I took
possession of it as a heritage, though he still had
many good years of life left in him at that date. I
well remember, too, that at one of the first dinner
parties I went to at St. Andrews, at the most hospitable
house of Captain "Dan" Stewart, Mr. Wolfe-Murray
greeted me warmly, saying that he had known my
grandfather who, as he affirmed, was in the habit of
declaring that he had "the best left leg in Bond
Street, and," added Mr. Wolfe-Murray, "I think
my left leg is better than my right." He was gloriously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
arrayed in the dining dress of the Queen's Archers,
which permitted a display of legs; but this story
of a day when legs were so draped as to be critically
admired in Bond Street took the mind's eye back
a long way. The point of my grandfather's claim,
however, as to the beauty of his left leg, was that the
symmetry of the right had been somewhat spoilt
by a French musket ball.</p>

<p>And the kindliness that I met with, from many
who had not any of these special links, was not to be
forgotten&mdash;Mr. Gilbert Mitchell Innes, Mr. Balfour,
the father of Leslie&mdash;now Balfour-Melville&mdash;Mr. Whyte-Melville,
to whose surname the former succeeded,
and very many more. Gilbert Innes was still, I think,
the best golfer of all those named, and David Lamb
and Jim Blackwell were about the best of the actual
residents. Leslie Balfour came over from Edinburgh
and I had many good matches with him. But on my
first arrival there I found that a match had already
been made for me by Victor Brooke, that I should
play Tom Kidd, at that moment thought to be playing
the best game of all the professionals at St. Andrews,
receiving the odds of a third from him. Tom Kidd
had been champion some ten years before, but,
champion or no, I had no idea at that time of day
of being beaten by anybody, professional or otherwise,
at odds of a third. Besides, I had come rather
fresh from a small triumph at Westward Ho! Somebody
had made up a little purse for the three Allan
brothers to play for, and in order to make an even
number I had been asked to play with one of them.
The prize was for the lowest score, and I was a proud
man when I came in with the best score of the four. We
had no formal definition of an amateur in those days,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
but in any case I should not have wished to take
the prize, which, indeed, I do not suppose would have
been given me. But this small victory put me into
fairly good conceit with myself in respect of this match
against poor Tom Kidd, who was certainly not as
good a golfer as Jamie Allan; but the truth is that
the Scots were rather sceptical in those days about
the golfing ability of any Southerner. It was not
very long before that young Tommy had given
Arthur Molesworth a third and a beating, as recorded
in a previous chapter. How that could have come
about I could not, nor can now, conceive; but at
any rate Tom Kidd was not Tommy Morris. I
remember that I went out the first nine holes in 42.
It does not sound very grand nowadays, but it was
respectable then, and sufficiently good to work up
Tom Kidd into elaborate explanations as to how
impossible it was to give a third to a score of that
kind. When a man gets into that explanatory mood
it is generally all over with him; and of course it
was not to be thought, if I could play anything of a
game at all, that he could give such odds. I won
an easy and inglorious victory, which would not be
worth mentioning except to show the estimate likely
to be made at St. Andrews at that time of the probable
form of an English amateur in comparison with
that of one of the native professionals.</p>

<p>Just about that time, that is to say 1883, Old Tom,
who had been playing for him very poorly, began to
enjoy a delightful Indian summer of his golf, which
gave the old man and all the many who were fond
of him immense delight. I do not mean to say that
I suppose him to have played anything like the game
of his best days. I could generally beat him, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
he would always play me level and liked to gamble
heavily. Generally there was a dozen of balls on
the match, and a dozen on the score, for we used
to keep the scores too, and often a dozen that I didn't,
and another dozen that he didn't, go round in some
set figure&mdash;say 87. A dozen balls meant only a dozen
shillings, in those days, but the number he was owing
me soon arrived at huge figures. However, I used
to knock the debt off his playing fee, and he was
perfectly happy, and so was I, in the arrangement.
He was very methodical, invariably half-filling the
bowl of a short-stemmed and ancient clay pipe as
he hit off to the Short Hole Going Out, and knocking
out its ashes as we came to the Short Hole Coming
In: and that was all the smoke he ever took till the
match was over.</p>

<p>On the occasion of this, my first visit to St. Andrews,
I was not a member of the Club, but they did me
the honour to elect me by next spring, and three
of us tied for the first medal at the not very clever
score of 91. Mr. Willie Wilson was one, I forget the
other; and Wilson won on the play off. I remember
that all went well with me till the sixth hole in the
tie, where I got into a small bunker from the tee,
took two to get out and left some of my temper
behind in it. I had to take second honour then,
but I won the first medal in the autumn, though I
think it was rather that the rest played worse than
that I played very well.</p>

<p>And then, immediately after the medal, came a
message from Elie and Earlsferry&mdash;"Would any
pair at St. Andrews give a match in a foursome to
a couple of stonemasons from Elie?" Leslie Balfour
asked me if I would play with him against them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
I knew I was not in good form, and I do not think
that he was, either, but still we said we would play
them. They came over and seemed very nice young
fellows indeed. The name of one was Douglas Rolland,
and that of the other Jack Simpson. We had never
heard of them before. We continued to think them
very nice young fellows until the ninth hole, at which
point we were two up. The truth is the masons had
not got their hammers going at all. But we did
not know that. On the way home we began to doubt
whether they were as nice as we had thought. Rolland
began hitting the ball to places where we had never
seen it hit before, and Simpson so followed up that
they were reaching with a drive and an iron holes that
it was at that date scarcely decent to approach in
this metallic way. They were "gutty" balls, mind,
which did not fly away off the irons like the rubber-cores.
They finished that round to the good of us,
and in the afternoon made us look very foolish indeed.
I do not think that Leslie or I ever got over that
match till we read the result of the open championship,
played very shortly afterwards at Prestwick.
It went "Jack Simpson first, Douglas Rolland second."
After that we could make a better reply when we
had to listen to the very kind and pointed enquiries
of friends as to "What sort of golfers are the stonemasons
of Elie? Are they any good?"</p>

<p>I think, but am not sure, that it must have been in
the interim between that match of ours and the
championship, that there was a great home and
home match, with something of a Scotch and English
flavour about it, got up between Douglas Rolland and
Johnny Ball. Captain Willy Burn wrote me an
account of the first part of the match at Elie, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
he went over from St. Andrews to see, and one of
the phrases in it I remember now: "Both men drove
like clockwork." It seems that Rolland, for all his
great hitting, had nothing the better of Johnny&mdash;who
was a very fine driver in his youth&mdash;in that respect,
but hole after hole went from Johnny on the putting
green. He came to Hoylake, for the second half
of the match, no less than nine holes to the bad. The
local people said that he would pick it all up on his
own green. But he did not: on the contrary he
lost more holes. Then, on the following day a second
match was arranged&mdash;of thirty-six holes, all to be
played on his own Hoylake. Of course he must
have started with the moral effect of his previous
hammering still deeply impressed upon him, but his
friends still had all confidence in him. And he seemed
to justify it grandly, playing such a fine game that
he was five up and six to play and the match was
virtually, as probably Rolland himself deemed, over,
when suddenly he struck a very bad streak, lost
hole after hole until all the lead was gone, and Rolland,
winning the last hole too, actually won this extraordinary
match. It was a very sad day for Hoylake,
and that is the aspect of the match which seems to have
impressed everybody. But, after all, there is another
aspect&mdash;perhaps well realized at Elie&mdash;what a first-class
fighting man that Rolland was! Johnny Ball had
in fact to go through a very long baptism of fire
before he was able to bring his wonderful powers and
skill to their full use at the moment they were most
needed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h4>THE BEGINNINGS OF THE AMATEUR
CHAMPIONSHIP
</h4>

<p>Golf had jogged along very comfortably up to
this time with its one championship, open to
amateurs as to professionals, but never as yet won
by an amateur. Then, in the winter of 1884-5 it
occurred to some original genius of the Club at Hoylake&mdash;"why
not a championship to be restricted to
the amateurs?" I do not know whose great brain
first flashed out the idea, but they wrote and explained
it to me, asked me to serve on a Committee for the
purpose, and gradually the scheme was licked into
something more or less like shape. It was decided
to hold, under the auspices of the Royal Liverpool
Club, a tournament, under match play rules, open to
all amateurs. The Club gave a handsome prize,
or, rather, two prizes. I went up to Hoylake a little
while before the affair came off, and there found the
Committee in charge in something of a difficulty.
Douglas Rolland had sent in his entry and they did
not know how to deal with it. You see, at that date
we had no definition of a professional, nor of an amateur,
and had to decide on the analogy of other sports.
I was all for accepting Rolland's entry then, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
am of the same opinion now&mdash;that it ought to have
been received.</p>

<p>His offence was that, having come in second to Jack
Simpson in the previous year for the open championship,
he had accepted the second prize money, thereby
violating the law common to several sports and
pastimes forbidding an amateur to receive a money
prize when in competition with professionals. That
would have been all plain sailing but for the unfortunate
fact that it was discovered that Johnny Ball, some
years before, and while still quite a boy, had played
himself into the prize list at an open championship
and had been offered, and without a thought about
the matter had accepted, a sum that I think amounted
to no less than ten shillings. It was, of course, unthinkable
that Johnny should be deprived of his birthright
as an amateur for such a boyish error as this. There
never was the faintest suspicion of professionalism
about any act of Johnny Ball's extraordinary golfing
life, but technically, at that date, his case and Rolland's
were very much on all fours. I saw that the Committee,
or a majority of them, were resolved to reject
Rolland's entry. I did not care to be a member
of a Committee which rejected, for a cause I could
not quite approve, the entry of one who would certainly
be a very formidable competitor for a tournament
which I had a distant hope that I might possibly
win. I therefore asked leave to resign from the
Committee, before the vote was taken on the point,
and did so, with perfectly amiable sentiments all round.
I have been rather long-winded perhaps in this explanation,
but I wanted to make clear to those who are not
informed about it the reason why the present amateur
definition is drafted just as it is, with a time limit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
beyond which&mdash;that is to say before sixteen years of
age&mdash;a man shall be held guiltless of having done
any action to spoil his amateur status in playing for
a money prize in competition with professionals.</p>

<p>So that was settled, and Rolland's entry disallowed.
It passed off with less trouble than I had expected,
perhaps just because Rolland was such a thoroughly
good fellow, whether he were professional or amateur,
and not at all of that small spirit which is apt to
take offence where none is meant.</p>

<p>We set to work to play our tournament. It was
considered best not to entitle it a championship,
seeing that it was the installation of a single club only,
and had no official recognition. Funny things began
to happen from the start. It gave much delight
to the men of Hoylake that I should have drawn, as
my first foe, my old enemy at Westward Ho! Arthur
Molesworth. Him I managed to beat with tolerable
ease. I think he had even then begun to lose the
sting of his game. After that I rather forget my
fortunes until the semi-final heat, when I came up
against Johnny Ball. In a previous heat, by the
way, he had committed the crime of parricide, knocking
out his own father, who put up a stout fight against
him, nevertheless. Johnny and I had a great contest,
and I thought he was going to beat me, for he was
two up at the turn; but I began to play rather well
from there onwards and beat him by two upon the
last green.</p>

<p>In that tournament we had not the arrangement
which was made as soon as the amateur championship
was put on an official footing&mdash;that is to say, in
the very next year&mdash;of all byes being played off in
the first round. The effect of that was that Alan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Macfie, the other semi-finalist, had a bye in the morning.
The final was decided in a single round to be played
in the afternoon. I had been wound up to high
concert pitch by that morning round with Johnny
and could not play a bit in the afternoon. Macfie,
on the other hand, putted like a demon and never
made a mistake, so very likely the result would have
been just the same if I too had been idle all the morning.
He beat me, I think, by eight holes.</p>

<p>So that was the conclusion of it, and really it was
most unfortunate for Macfie that he had not official
right to place his name at the head of the list of amateur
champions, for this was in all respects, except the title,
equivalent to a championship. Leslie Balfour was
not there, but Johnny Laidlay was. It was the first
time that I made his acquaintance, though I did
not have to play him. He was knocked out at an
early period of the campaign. In fact I am pretty
sure that he was not playing as fine a game then
as he developed later. His putting, in particular,
improved greatly, and so did the direction of his
driving. His iron play was always, from the first,
unsurpassed. I think that according to the arrangements
of that tournament all ties must have gone on
into the next round, for I well remember that Walter
de Zoete tied twice with Macfie and was beaten by
him on their third time of meeting, when Macfie,
amongst other atrocities, did the short hole (the Rush
Hole) in one. De Zoete went very strongly in the
tournament. One of his victims was Mure Ferguson,
whom he beat by eight and seven. There must,
of course, have been something wrong here: I am
not sure that gout would not come into the diagnosis.</p>

<p>And somewhere or other, among the crowd of
lookers on at that tournament, with a heart very
black with rage against me at my presumption in
daring to beat the local hero, Johnny Ball, would have
been a little boy of the name of Harold Hilton: a
name to be heard of in later years.</p>

<p>That was the beginning, the preface, the preliminary
canter, of the amateur championship, and it is to the
initiative and enterprise of the men of Hoylake in
getting up that tournament and conducting it to success,
that we owe all the fun and all the tears we have
had out of that championship since. No doubt it,
or something like it, would have come sooner or
later, whether or no, but it was due to the Hoylake
Club that it came just as soon as it did. In the
later course of that year it was taken properly in hand:
the chief Clubs in the Kingdom gave it their sanction and
subscribed to buy a challenge cup for it; rules were
drawn up; the definition of an amateur was framed,
and the first amateur championship meeting on these
lines was put on the programme to be held at St.
Andrews the following year.</p>

<p>Now, seeing that this veracious and highly egotistic
record aims at being a serious contribution to the golfing
history of modern times, as well as a sketch of my little
personal share in it, it might be worth while just to
note the names of the Clubs which subscribed for that
amateur championship cup. For the subscribers were
all the principal Clubs of Great Britain at that time,
and anyone who has not looked over the list lately
may very well feel something of the same surprise that
the little boy experienced when he found himself in
Heaven&mdash;surprise both at some of those who were
there and also at some of those who were not there.
All the more notable of the great inland golf Clubs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
for instance, are conspicuous by their absence; and
for the perfectly sound reason that they had not yet
come into being, nor indeed had inland golf yet begun
to be deemed at all worthy of consideration. There
are, to be sure, the Royal Blackheath and the Royal
Wimbledon. These are great in respect and veneration,
but they no longer lead. St. George's at Sandwich
was admitted to the sacred number of contributing
Clubs many years later, when it came into existence and
when its merits were proved well to warrant the inclusion
of its course among the championship greens. And
during all the first years of the amateur championship's
existence it was my duty, acting on instructions from
the Royal North Devon Club, to point out how very
worthy was Westward Ho! to be the scene for that
encounter, and also (but this was ever received with
a bland smile in which, after a course of years, I began
to join) how very central was its situation and how
easy of approach from all directions. It has taken
a lapse of many years and a more moving eloquence
than mine to convince the management of the championship
on these so obvious points; but now that
they are convinced they accord the links of the West
all their due recognition. The original subscribing
Clubs then, who gave the weight of their authority
to the new championship, were the following:&mdash;Royal
and Ancient; Royal Liverpool; Royal Albert, Montrose;
Royal North Devon; Royal Aberdeen; Royal
Blackheath; Royal Wimbledon; Alnmouth; North
Berwick, New Club; Panmure, Dundee; Prestwick
Club; Bruntsfield Links, Edinburgh; Dalhousie
Club; Edinburgh Burghers; Formby; Gullane;
Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers; Innerleven;
King James VIth, Perth; Kilspindie; Tan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>tallon;
Troon; West Lancashire. Is it not the
case, that there are surprises in this list, both in the
form of those who are in it and those who are
not?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h4>ON GOLF BOOKS AND GOLF BALLS</h4>


<p>In the year 1886 I perpetrated a book on golf.
The only excuse to be made for it is that which
was offered in another famous instance, that "it
was a very little one." It was a much more notorious
thing in those days to write a book about golf than
it is now, for who is there now who has not done
so? But in that golden age the whole bibliography
of the game was comprised, I think, in four volumes&mdash;<i>Golf,
a Royal and Ancient Game</i>, by that gallant
old warrior at the game, Mr. Robert Clark; Stewart's
<i>Golfiana Miscellanea</i>; and two small didactic treatises,
the one by Chambers and the other by Forgan. I
had a great many compliments paid me on my little
book, <i>Hints on Golf</i>, when it first came out. I sent
the manuscript to Mr. "Bill" Blackwood, and he
eagerly consented to publish it, "for," he wrote, "I
am sure there must be something in that book. Ever
since I read it I have been trying to play according
to its advice, and the result is that I've entirely lost
any little idea of the game I ever had." That was
gratifying praise, and an edition or two was soon
sold out. Then it occurred to me to illustrate its
wisdom with figures in single lines. A little later I
was dancing with a young lady I had just been introduced
to in London and asked her whether she played<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
golf and she replied, "Oh, yes, we all play, and we
learn out of a most idiotic little book we've got."
"Ah, yes," I said, "is it a little book with single
line figures illustrating it?" "Yes, yes," she said
eagerly. "That's it. Do you know it?" "A little,"
I replied.</p>

<p>One remark in the book took the popular fancy&mdash;that
"Golf is not agriculture." It was made to
point the moral that the golfer should replace his
divots. But the only passage that seems to me at
all worth quoting at length, although I did write the
whole book myself, is one which illustrates the temporary
and historical importance of a controversy
which is entirely forgotten now. The passage is
Number I. of "The Miseries of Golf," and runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Discovering, as you walk down to the tee, to
start a foursome, that your partner has never in his
life played a round with a 'putty' (eclipse) ball, while
you yourself know that you cannot play within one
half of your game with a 'gutty' (gutta-percha)
ball."</p>

<p>All through the early eighties a good deal of experimenting
had been going on with the view of discovering
a substitute for gutta-percha for the golf ball. When
I first went to St. Andrews, Commander Stewart
was there, having just produced his "Stewart Patent"
balls. They were of some composition, and were
filled with steel filings. They had some merits,
but were very heavy. All golf balls used to be numbered
then: 27 and 28 were the usual sizes, supposed
to signify the weight in drachms, and I remember
Logan White telling Commander Stewart, "We tried
weighing your balls yesterday. We put a 27 of yours
in one side of the balance and we had to put a 28<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
gutty and the coal-scuttle in the other, to make it
level." Slight exaggeration, but pointing towards a
truth!</p>

<p>It was the fault of these balls that they were too
heavy. Then some firm in Edinburgh produced a
ball called the Eclipse, and after several modifications
they put out a ball that had distinct qualities of its
own, in some points superior to gutta-percha balls.
They would not carry so well&mdash;they were dead, and
with wonderfully little resilience when dropped on
a stone&mdash;soft, so that a finger and thumb squeeze
could compress them sensibly, but the compression
came out again. That was one of the merits of this
ball, which inevitably&mdash;its qualities being such as
they were&mdash;received the nickname of "putty," to
rhyme pleasantly with "gutty": it would come
out again, resuming its spherical shape without any
disturbance of contour, even after the most desperate
hammering on the head with an iron. It was indestructible.
Then it was a wonderful ball for keeping
its line on the putting green&mdash;far the best putting
ball that ever has come into being during the half-century
or so of golf that I have known. But the
quality, which perhaps was its highest virtue, was that
it did not go off the line nearly as much as the gutty
when pulled or sliced. I used to play with a "putty,"
as a rule, when I played against Old Tom. The old
man hated the ball, as indeed did most of the professionals.
Trade reasons weighed heavily with many
of them, but I do not think that the old man was
commercial-minded enough for these to have the
slightest effect with him. He might have made a
large fortune had he possessed but a little more of
this spirit, but it was in his utter freedom from it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
that much of his charm consisted. Still he cordially
hated "the potty," as he called it. Of course it
was possible to pull or slice the putty, if you played
badly enough, though it did not take the cut nearly
as freely as the gutty, and whenever I pulled or sliced
one of them to perdition the old man's delight knew
no bounds. The fun would come twinkling out of
his eyes under their shaggy brows and he would say,
"Eh, they potties&mdash;I thocht they potties never gaed
aff the line."</p>

<p>Willie Fernie was the only one of the professionals
who ever condescended much to them, and I have
been playing with him when he used a putty going
out at St. Andrews, in the teeth of the wind, and
then took a gutty coming home down wind. But
he did not make much of it. The two balls required
such a very different touch for the short game that
it was very difficult to go from one to the other&mdash;it
is in that that the point lies of the above quotation
from my "idiotic little book." But Willie Fernie
was a man of infinite ingenuity. The ball, evidently
from what I have said of it, was a fine ball against
the wind&mdash;it kept so low and so straight. On hard
ground it would make up in its run for its loss in
carry, and therefore it was a better ball on the flatter
than on the more mountainous links. But in this
account of its qualities, I have also indicated its
defects. Running as it did when it pitched, it was
an impossible ball to stop on the green off a lofted
shot; and just as it would not take much cut, so
as to go far to right or left when heeled or toed, so
it would not take a cut when one purposely tried to
put a cut on to stop it.</p>

<p>On the whole I liked the ball. It was very economi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>cal,
because it would last for ever and because its
soft substance did not inflict such damage on the
clubs as the hard "gutty." I won both the first
two amateur championships with a putty ball. I
do not mean that I used the same ball in each. But
Andy Stuart had a putty ball with which&mdash;the same
identical ball&mdash;he won three St. Andrews' medals.
The great argument against them was the difficulty
aforesaid of stopping them off the pitch. That, and
their lack of carry, were their weak points: their
straight travel, especially off the putter, was their
strong point. And then, all at once, the manufacturers
began to make them less good. Just what happened
I never knew. I think that they changed the mixture
in order to get them harder, and, so, more like the
"gutties"; but whatever the reason, the effect was
that they lost much of their merits and never overcame
their defects. Result&mdash;exit the putty ball
towards the end of the eighties, and the gutty holding
the market until the Americans sent us what at first
were called Haskells; which is another and more
modern story.</p>

<p>I had written, at the commencement of my little
book, that I had seen a recent advertisement of an
outfitting firm, "The Game of Golf Complete, in a
Box." It suggested a <i>multum in parvo</i>. I went on
to say, "if anyone would only write us 'The Art
of Golf, complete, in a Book'&mdash;why, what more
could be left to wish for?" But I added, "I am
afraid no one will ever be quite bold enough to attempt
that." And hardly were those words published before
out came Sir Walter Simpson, greatly daring, with
a book actually called <i>The Art of Golf</i>. He did not
add "complete, in a Book"; but no doubt that is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
how he meant it. And an admirably witty and
humorous book it was, and is. Its wit and humour
abide with us. Just what value it ever had as an
education in the art I hardly know. Walter Simpson,
poor fellow (he died while comparatively a young
man), never was a first-class golfer, though he was a
first-class companion for a round. We who were
pleased to rate ourselves the best of the amateurs
could give him about a third, and there were many
strokes in the game of which he had no idea, but
his book, like himself, is excellent company. Quite
a modern book, having the same title (which is
rather a pity), has come out lately, by Joshua Taylor,
the champion's brother. I will refrain from comparisons.
But I suppose that at the date I am writing
of, the world, for the time being, had enough of golf
literature, for I cannot think of any work in book
form on the great subject until the Badminton Golf
Volume, in 1890; and I remember an article of
Professor Tait's written in the late eighties in which he
speaks of "the magnificent Clark, the voluminous
Simpson and the sardonic Hutchinson," with the
suggestion that these three virtually comprised the
whole of the bibliography of golf as generally known
to the public. How far pens have travelled over
how many of the reams of the paper so appropriately
termed foolscap in the quarter of a century or so
since, we may consider with much amazement&mdash;and
here am I still piling up the leagues!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h4>THE FIRST AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP</h4>


<p>The first amateur championship, as by law
established, was played at St. Andrews, and
started for me, as I suppose did most things at that
time of life, on the note of comedy. It must be
understood that this institution meant a great gathering
of clans and of clansmen not very well known
to each other. I dare say some of us had our own
ideas that no one was likely to be unearthed from
the dark places able to upset reputations more or
less established; but everything was possible. I
had, carrying for me, one of the numerous family
of Greig at St. Andrews; I presume some connection
of the fine golfer of that name and of his brother,
the lion-voiced starter. Of course, the prospects
of the championship were the great subject of discussion,
and during my first match of the tournament&mdash;I
think things must have been going fairly easily,
and that I had my opponent pretty well in hand&mdash;he
said to me, "There's a mon Fogie, frae Earlsferry,
and they say he's gaein' tae win the chompionship.
He's a terrible fine player an' he daes na' mind
the gallery a dom." This was terrific news to me.
By "the mon Fogie" I understood him to mean a
Mr. Foggo of Earlsferry, whose name I had noticed
on the list of the draw, and had noticed further that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
this Mr. Foggo would be my own fate in the second
round of the tournament. That is, of course, always
on the assumption that he and I both survived;
and of his survival, after Greig's remarks, I had no
doubt. When I came in I heard to my surprise,
as well, I may say, as to my relief, that this terror
of Earlsferry had actually been defeated and knocked
out on the last green by Dr. McCuaig. Of Dr. McCuaig
I did not know very much; and then, on the evening
of that day, it was reported to me that he had said,
"I shall beat Horace Hutchinson to-morrow. I
believe he is a good player, but he is a young player.
You'll see; I shall beat him." This was retailed to
me, and whether it were a true saying of the doctor's
or whether the retailer had merely invented it to
see how I should take it, and to raise my ire, I do
not know to this day; but I do know that it did
raise my ire, and that I went out in the morning with
a very grim determination to play my hardest. I
had no idea of any amateur starting out with the
expectation that he was going to beat me, unless,
indeed, it were Johnny Ball. I played steadily;
the doctor was not at all at his best, and I won&mdash;I
think it was the first seven holes. At all events,
it was such a number as made the match a very
comfortable one. The doctor took his beating in
the best of spirits, and bore no ill-feeling whatever.</p>

<p>Altogether that was a comfortable championship.
After the first thrill of the terror inspired by the
reputation of "the mon Fogie," it went on oiled
wheels. Mure Ferguson, I remember, whom I met
in a later heat, was a hole up going to the eleventh,
and I was a little anxious, but he let me win in the
end, though only by a hole, and then it looked very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
much as if I should have to play Johnny Ball in
the final&mdash;which was never to be regarded as a holiday.
But the unexpected happened. In the semi-final he
had to meet Henry Lamb. Henry Lamb was a beautiful
golfer. It was he who invented the "bulger,"
that club with its convex face, off which the ball
flew with a straightness that was a revelation. You
see, before the bulger was invented, the faces of our
wooden clubs, by the perpetual contact and hammering
of the hard "gutty" balls, always got worn
away, so that instead of being flat, they were very
decidedly concave. And you may understand what
the effect of that gradient of face would be&mdash;to emphasize
and aggravate every sin of heeling or toeing to
which golfing flesh is heir. Therefore, the good influence
of the bulger was not really so much in introducing
the first convexity, though that in itself helped the
ball to go straight off it, but it also corrected that fatal
concavity which all clubs soon assumed of which the
faces were flat to start with. Instead of being concave,
after much battering, the face of the bulger became
merely flat.</p>

<p>So it was a blessed invention; and as to its inventor,
he was not only a player of a very fine and graceful
game of golf, but he was also the most delightful
fellow to play with that could be imagined. He
had a temper which in its perfect serenity was a most
valuable golfing asset to himself, and also most valuable
in the charm of the companionship which it brought
into a round of golf with him. His mode of addressing
the ball was remarkable, for he stood as if he were
going to drive at an angle of at least forty-five degrees
to the right of the hole. I remember, at some inland
course in the South, where his strange method was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
not known, a caddie calling out to him as he was on
the point of driving from the first tee: "Stop,
stop, you're playing to the wrong hole." Henry
Lamb gave the boy one of his sweetest and most
lamb-like smiles, and proceeded to drive the ball
two hundred yards straight down the middle of the
course&mdash;to square leg. He used to swing round
so far as he came down that really it was to the cricketer's
square leg that he drove; and yet his style
was a singularly graceful one, which seems as if it
could not be. It was a singularly effective one
no less, and he was a medallist on most of the courses
then known to the golfer. Still, he was not a Johnny
Ball. On that day, however, he proved himself a
greater than Johnny Ball, who was far from being
at his best, and when I came in from my own semi-final
effort I learned, with a breath of even deeper
relief than I had given to the shade of the defunct
"mon Fogie," that Henry Lamb and not Johnny was
my man for the final. Neither of us started well in
that final round&mdash;it was only of eighteen holes in
those days; but I began to get going after the fourth
hole, and Henry Lamb was, I think, a little done after
his match with Johnny. At all events, he let the holes
slip away very quickly, and I had an easy win, on
which he was the first to offer his congratulations&mdash;a
very courteous gentleman!</p>

<p>The intelligent student of golfing history up to
this period might very well note, and with some
surprise, that whenever reference is made to Johnny
Ball it always seems to be as of one disappointing
expectation. And that, in truth, was very much
the case. Men of Hoylake used to come to me almost
with tears in their eyes, because they knew that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
had my full sympathy and understanding. They
knew that I knew what a terror Johnny Ball really
was on his own course and when playing his right
game. But what afflicted them almost to hysterics
was that he never seemed able to produce this wonderful
best of his when he went away to play anywhere
else than at home; and the consequence of that was
that the other folk, the Scotsmen, laughed at them,
saying: "This local idol of yours has feet of very
poor clay"&mdash;or gibes to that effect. They took it
very badly. It is hardly to be believed now, when
we know what a brilliant lot of victories in all fields
Johnny has to his credit, that he had to wait a very
weary while, and to suffer a number of disappointments,
before he began to come to his due. When
he did come, he was not to hold nor to bind.</p>

<p>Johnny Laidlay did nothing effective in this first
championship. He, too, had to "bide a wee" before
he did all that was expected of him; but I made
his much better acquaintance about this time and
acquired the greatest respect for his game, especially
for the accuracy and delicacy of his approaches with
the mashie. It was a new club to me, and something
of a revelation in its possibilities. For it would, of
itself and without any special effort of the player,
do all to the ball that might be done with our old
irons only after a deal of cut had been carefully put
on. I do not at all regret that labour; it was an
excellent education; but there is no doubt that the
mashie simplified the approaching problems. It made
an easier game of it. I have been looking up the
details of this championship, and find one of its "points"
to have been the meeting of Johnny Ball and Johnny
Laidlay, the first of very many encounters of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
kind, resulting in the English Johnny's win by three
and two. So that was the fate of the Scot; he
fell by no unworthy hand. There is always consolation
in this reflection. Henry Lamb, as I read
on the same record, had fought his way to the final
over the corpses of some stout foes. The first round
gave him a bye; but then he had to meet Mr. Charles
Anderson, forgotten by golfers of to-day, but a stalwart
in his time. Next, Harry Everard fell to him; and
then he had a bigger man than either, especially at
St. Andrews, in Leslie Balfour. He beat Leslie at
the last hole. Then, in the semi-final, he beat Johnny
Ball by no less than seven and six to play, and it was
by the same sufficient margin that I defeated him.
What Johnny can have been doing I hardly know.
That he must have been playing some game widely
different from his real one is very certain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<h4>MR. ARTHUR BALFOUR AND HIS INFLUENCE
IN GOLF</h4>


<p>It is not on first sight very obvious how the appointment
of a statesman to the Chief Secretaryship
for Ireland can have an intimate bearing on the history
of the game of golf. Nevertheless that appointment,
in the year 1886, of Mr. Arthur Balfour had, in my
humble judgment, an important influence and bearing
on the game. It so happened that about this time an
eminent weekly journal had propounded the statement
that none but stupid people played golf, and even
that the successful playing of golf demanded, as an
essential condition, that the player should be stupid
and destitute of all imagination and of all intellectual
interests. It was rather an extravagant statement.
At the same time also the office of the Irish Secretary
was invested with a peculiar importance in the public
eye. It was not long after the tragic affair in the Phoenix
Park. Ireland was seething with murderous discontent.
The man who accepted the secretaryship
took his life in his hand with that acceptance, and
this risk Mr. Balfour took with all his characteristic
coolness and courage. He became at once, both on
this account and because of his record as a still rather
untried statesman, as a "philosophic doubter" and
as a distinguished figure in a certain set of Society<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to which the name of "Souls" had been rather
foolishly given, perhaps the most popular figure in
politics. The public eye was upon him and it was
known that this man of so many and so varied gifts
was an enthusiastic golfer. He went round the
links as an object lesson to contradict the unfortunate
pronouncement of the aforesaid respectable paper
about the stupidity essential to the man who would
confess himself a golfer.</p>

<p>He also went round the links accompanied at a
decent interval by two detectives. I used to play
a good deal with him at North Berwick at that time,
and it was rather curious to know that we were being
stalked every step of the way by these guardians
skirmishing among the sandhills and the fringes
of the course. It did not in the least interfere with
Arthur Balfour's equanimity and concentration on
the game. Of course he was not a great golfer,
though he brought to the game that faculty which
was so invaluable to him in politics of rising to an
occasion. You were in good hands if he were your
partner and you left him with a putt of just the
doubtful distance to win the match at the last hole.
But though he was not a great golfer, he was a very
great figure in golf; and just because it is very human
to be influenced by an example, the effect of his
example was to make many a man play golf, on the
principle that "there must be something in a game
if a fellow like Arthur Balfour plays it." He had
been a fine tennis player at Cambridge, and was
an extraordinarily good shot at a stag. I used to
stalk on the splendid forest of Strathconan which he
sold to Mr. Combe, the father of Christian Combe,
the present owner, and the stalkers there have spoken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
to me with bated breath of his deadliness of aim
with those old-fashioned rifles which tossed the bullet
along in a high curve, and with black powder that
made all nature invisible for a minute after the shot.
Twenty-six stags without a miss, was his record, as
reported to me by one of these stalkers, for one season,
and it is a wonderful record in the conditions, especially
as he was short-sighted. But then he had, by compensation,
not only an accurate vision, but a coolness
of nerve which made any idea of "stag-fever" an
impossibility to conceive in connection with him. And
"putt-fever" at golf was equally far from him.</p>

<p>I am very far indeed from saying that if golf had not
been at this moment just ready for a "boom" the
example of Arthur Balfour would have set the boom
going, but as a matter of fact it was just ready. Courses
were being made and Clubs founded all over the
country, the amateur championship was both a cause
and an effect of the new impulse, and then came
the beat of the Balfour drum and the note of "Ca
ira" came from it triumphantly. I date from that
year, and principally as arising from the sources
indicated, that "boom" which has never ceased
to march and which is marching still. So much for
what the incentive of one man's example may be in
a race still generously capable of hero-worship.</p>

<p>For a while at North Berwick Arthur Balfour's
chief henchman was Crawford, Big Crawford, as he
was most appropriately called, about whom many
a legend clings in North Berwick tradition. The
big Crawford was also the caddie of little Sayers in
any of the important matches played by that great
little man. The Crawford legend might run to far
lengths, farther than I care to spin it now, but of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
all the instances of his wit and repartee the best I
think is that which he produced, perfectly impromptu,
so far as I know, when there arose a great discussion
as to the precise nature of a toad-stool in course of
a match which Sayers, his little man, played against
Andrew Kirkaldy at St. Andrews. It was lifted,
the lifter saying that it was a dead and loose-lying
toad-stool, the objector that it had been rooted in
the ground and therefore was not legally liftable.
The discussion instantly raised numerous side-issues,
as to one of which Crawford, having delivered his
opinion, heavily, of course, in favour of the view of
the case that would assist Ben Sayers&mdash;pronounced,
finally, "Weel, het's the rule o' the game, an'&mdash;&mdash;"
at this point he paused an instant and lifted an enormous
fist, "an'," he repeated, indicating this leg
of mutton bunch of knuckles, "there's the referee!"
It is not the first time, nor the seventh time, that
I have told this story; nor do I care if I repeat it
seventy times seven. It is good enough to bear
it.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of an historic home and home
foursome in which Sayers and Davie Grant defeated
Andrew and Hugh Kirkaldy, Crawford would demand
of any whom he could get to listen who it was, in
their opinion, that had won the match, and when
they professed a doubt, he would draw himself up
with enormous dignity to his immense height, and
striking himself dramatically on the chest, would
exclaim with conviction, if not with grammar&mdash;"Me!"
and really it was not altogether too large a claim.
His overmastering size and the fearsome aggressiveness
of his manner might very well give pause to
any tactics of an aggressive nature on the other side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
He was a tower of moral (or immoral) support to
little Sayers, and his presence at the hole when a
hostile putter was attempting to approach it had all
the effect of a black cloud overshadowing the atmosphere.
But beneath all his dourness, and his sardonic
air, he had a kindly nature, and of his loyalty to him
whom he regarded as his chief, and incidentally the
greatest man that ever lived, Arthur Balfour, there
is not the slightest question.</p>

<p>With his rugged independence, he might stand as
the type of the old Scottish caddie, now practically
extinct. In later years he set up a booth at the far
end of the North Berwick links where he would dispense
ginger-beer and the like innocent refreshment, though
it was said that to the initiate few a more generous
and cordial liquid might be proffered. I do not
know. What I do know is that when we went out,
of a morning, and came to Crawford at his booth,
he would often ask us, "Is Ar-rthur oot the day?"
rolling the "r's" upon his tongue as if he loved to
prolong the sound of his hero's name. It is thus that
he would put the question&mdash;for all his worship,
making use of the familiar first name. And then,
if we were able to comfort his soul by the assurance
that the great man would soon appear, he would
hoist a little flag on the booth's peak, for honour's
sake. And one day it happened that the Grand
Duke Michael of Russia, coming to the tent and seeing
the flag, inquired of Crawford in whose honour it
was flying. I do not know whether the Grand Duke
had been put up to making the inquiry, and asked
it humorously, to see what Crawford would say. At
all events he had his satisfaction, for in answer to the
query, "Whom is yon flag flying for?" the uncompromising reply was given, "A better mon than
you." No doubt loyalty here leaped over the bounds
of courtesy, but there is sign of a better quality than
mere rudeness in the reply. Very well must Crawford
have known that if he had chosen to reply to the
foreign prince that it was in his honour that the bunting
waved, it might have meant a piece of gold transferred
from the princely pocket to Crawford's, but he did
not hesitate. Partly perhaps the native disdain
of the foreigner rang in the reply, but chiefly I think
a very rugged honesty, which, in spite of the lamentably
rude form of the speech, has its dignity.</p>

<p>We had great fun on the short North Berwick
course, in those days, where nothing really paid you
but accuracy in the pitch, developed to a nicety
by Johnny Laidlay, who was always there. And
besides him were Walter de Zoete, poor John Penn
and many good golfers besides. I think it was with
me as partner that Arthur Balfour first played that
foursome against De Zoete, and Penn, which afterwards,
with Johnny Laidlay taking my place, was played
times without number. "Mike" Mitchell was one
of the regular frequenters, in the Eton holidays,
and playing with him as partner he and I once did
three successive holes in two each on that old short
course.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h4>THE SECOND AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP</h4>


<p>In 1887 we were back, for the amateur championship,
on that Hoylake links which was the arena
of the preliminary trial trip that Macfie won in 1885.
I see that Arthur Molesworth was in that tournament
of 1887, and survived until the fourth round, where
he was beaten by J.G. Tait, eldest brother of poor
Freddy. Another name of note is that of a small
boy, appearing in such big company for the first
time, Harold Hilton. He was beaten in the third
round by Mr. John Ball, "old John Ball," as we
called him for many years, although when I first
went to Hoylake he was only John Ball the second,
his father and Johnny's grandfather being still alive.
One of the most remarkable points in the championship
of the year was the game that Johnny's father put
up all through it. It never was a showy affair at all,
that game of his, but it was wonderful how effective
it was on the Hoylake course which he knew as well
as the inside of his own pocket. He beat Hilton,
as noted, then he knocked out J.G. Gibson, the Black-heathen,
who had been going strongly and had defeated
Henry Lamb the round before; and in the fifth round,
which was the semi-final, I came up against him.
I had only survived the previous round by the skin
of my teeth, and remember all about it well. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
against Mr. Gregor Macgregor, a sound player, and a
Scot, as his name suggests. I was getting on fairly
comfortably with him, with a hole or two in hand,
when he played a stroke in which I was morally
sure that he hit the ball twice. I did not know
whether to claim the point or not, and, not being
possessed of the ideally equable temperament, was
upset by the incident and played the last holes very
badly, halving the round and being rather lucky
to win the nineteenth hole. I forget whether, in
point of fact, I did claim that foul, which I knew
that Mr. Macgregor was quite unconscious of making,
but what I do know is that I received from him
afterwards one of the very nicest letters ever written,
saying how sorry he was that anything of the kind
should have happened, and that I should have been
upset at all. So the conclusion of that nineteenth
hole left me with John Ball, the elder, to play in the
semi-final; and meanwhile that other John Ball,
whom we distinguished as Johnny, was knocking
Jack Tait out in the other semi-final. They were
playing ahead of us, and as we went to the seventeenth
(now the sixteenth) hole old John Ball was one
up on me. And I had not played at all badly; only
he had played in the most gallant way and had really
hardly made a mistake. He was one up sheerly
on the merits.</p>

<p>Then he said to me, as we walked after our second
shots to the seventeenth hole and an emissary came
back to say that Johnny had beaten Jack Tait, "It
would be a funny thing if father and son had to play
it off together." It was an innocent remark enough,
and yet it nettled me a little, and I said in answer,
"Wait a bit, Mr. Ball: you haven't done with me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
yet." Perhaps I ought not to have said it: it was
rather a boastful answer. I can only plead the
excuse of comparative youth. I sincerely hope it
was not that reply which put him off his next stroke,
but something bothered him as he played it. I
saw him look up once, as he addressed the ball, at
the legs of the people standing (or not standing as
still as they should have been) opposite him. Anyone
who knows Hoylake will know the stroke he had
to play&mdash;to pop the ball over the cross bunker before
the green, of the then seventeenth and now sixteenth
hole. What happened was that he took his eye off
and popped the ball into the bunker instead. I lofted
mine over all right and won that hole. Then, by a
lucky approach and a good putt, I got the last in
three; and that was a stroke better than the hole
ought to be done in and one too good for Mr. Ball.</p>

<p>So then the next, and the final, problem was the
worst&mdash;Johnny! I dare say I was a little lucky in
that match: I know I had one rather lucky shot.
I got into the bunker just before the green, going
to the short hole, called the Cop. I dug the ball
out, pretty near the hole, and holed the putt. It
was fortunate, but I have always contended that
with practice, the judgment of the strength with this
dig shot is not nearly so difficult as it seems to the
uninitiated, and at Westward Ho! there was every
opportunity for initiation, in the shape of bunkers
close to the hole. Moreover, in those days, there
was no rule forbidding you to test the consistency of
the sand by a trial dig into it before the real shot.
I have always thought the rule which forbids the
testing dig a very bad one, because a clever bunker
player ought to have the advantage of his cleverness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
and this prohibition takes away much of the advantage
and puts him more nearly on a level with the man
who has no idea of judging strength with this shot.
Then, two holes from home, Johnny broke his brassey.
I see that Mr. Everard, speaking of this incident in
the Badminton Book, described it as "the very bad
luck to break his favourite brassey." That is interesting
to note now, as a sign of the times. It indicates
an importance belonging to a brassey which it certainly
would not have now, when a full second shot with
a wooden club is hardly ever wanted. But of course
it was hard luck then, and perhaps it was due to that
that I got dormy one up. Then Johnny obligingly
topped his tee shot going to the last hole. I did not
play the hole very bravely, and had to hole rather
a good putt to get a four. I do not think Johnny
troubled to putt out. He was a little nearer than
I was, but not stoney. Anyhow, that was the conclusion
of a lucky championship for me.</p>

<p>This reference to the far greater importance, in
those days, of the brassey reminds me of a queer
notion that Johnny Laidlay had. If he had a big
match to play he always bought a new brassey for
it. His theory was that he could play better with
one that was strange to his hand. If this paradox
is at all to be explained it must be by psychic, rather
than physical reasons. I take it to mean that, just
because the club was strange to his hand, the strangeness
subconsciously suggested to him the need for
a closer keeping of the eye on the ball. And the
subconscious suggestions are always the best. I
may be quite wrong, but that is the only explanation
I can find for it. But in this again we see the vastly
greater importance of the brassey in the days when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the gutta-percha balls were used. It was equally
important with those eclipses with which I won both
these championships. Johnny Ball and Johnny Laidlay
always stuck to the gutties, I think. Certainly
the latter did, and so would I too, had the old short
course at North Berwick been my chief golfing haunt;
for there the value of the pitch shot was out of all
proportion greater than on the larger courses elsewhere.
But as for the reason why the brassey was
so much more in vogue then, it has been rather misunderstood.
It was not because you drive so much
further off the tee with the rubber-cored balls than
with the gutties&mdash;if both are hit dead true there is
not a mighty difference in this. But it is because
you can drive the rubber-cored balls so very much
further with the iron clubs than you could the gutties.
That is the great difference. Ironing range means a
considerably longer distance with the rubber-cores
than with the solid balls, and the distance gained by
taking a brassey instead of a driving mashie or a
cleek is as nothing compared with what it used to
be.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to draw a correct comparison
between these courses of St. Andrews and Hoylake,
then and now, in respect of the difficulties that each
presented to the golfer. The whins at St. Andrews
encroached, on what is now either the clear ground
of the course, or is dotted only with occasional trappy
bunkers amongst which the ball often finds quite a
good lie, in such a dense mass that a wandering
ball was hardly worth the trouble of looking for among
them. At Hoylake the little rushes, which are now
scarcely to be regarded as a hazard at all, used to
be very dense too, and in the summer and autumn a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
tough long grass grew among them, so that your ball
lay as if in a plover's nest, and sometimes it took
you several strokes to get out. It was a horrid hazard.
Then at some of the earlier and later holes of the
course the remaining posts and rails of the disused
racecourse were very vexing. To find yourself tight
up against a post was only a little less annoying than
to hit it with a full shot and to find your ball come
dancing back to you or flying past your head as if it
meant to brain you. All these things happened.
Then the rabbit holes were more numerous and came
farther out on the course. It was about this time that
I was moved to much fury in course of a match by seeing
my ball lying at the bottom of a burrow, where I
could not reach it, and, when I was on the point of
dropping another ball with loss of stroke (as was
specifically permitted by the local rule regarding rabbit
holes), being told, "You mayn't do that&mdash;it's a lost
ball." "Lost, be d&mdash;&mdash;d," I said. "What d'you
mean by lost? Why there it is: you can see it for
yourself." "Yes," said the other, "but a ball is lost
unless you can garther it"&mdash;he was a Scot, with
a patriotic accent, and he spoke of the ball as if it
were a daisy or other flower. I concluded the round
under protest and a cloud of wrath; and, what made
the cloud blacker&mdash;the Committee upheld the view
of the "gartherer." Possibly they may have been
right, but certainly I did not think so at the time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h4>THE FIRST GOLF IN AMERICA</h4>


<p>In the autumn of 1887 I did a very foolish thing:
I went to America. I do not by any means
imply that it is not an essential part of a liberal education
to visit that great country, nor do I mean that
it would be any act of foolishness on the part of a golfer
to go there now, but I do mean that in my own golfing
circumstances, and in the golfing conditions of the
States at that time&mdash;which was a condition of no
golf at all&mdash;it was very silly of me to go away from
golf for so long. For that is what it involved. I
was abroad for several months. At that date there
was no golf in the States. I did not touch a club
while I was there; and after I came back, after this
long while of letting the hand grow unfamiliar with
the club, the game never came so easy to me again.
From that experience I believe that it may be taken
as a maxim by all golfers who have learnt the game as
boys, that they run a risk of losing a measure of skill
and confidence, which they may never regain, if they
do not touch a club for many months together. You
see, this game that a man has grown up with, learning
it as his muscles grow, so that it is more or less literally
true that he has "grown into it," is rather different
from the game that he learns later, after his muscles
have set. The effect of going away from golf for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
long time is that you lose some of these lessons that
you have acquired as you grew; you have then to
re-learn them, so far as you may, as if they were a new
acquisition that you had to take possession of after
you have finished growing; and you never acquire
quite the same unconscious and instinctive grasp of
them.</p>

<p>I went to America again the following year. But
it did not matter then. The harm had been done;
the first and best lessons, or a large number of them,
were lost&mdash;their teaching laboriously and only partially
to be regained. And on that second visit I actually
did take out some clubs.</p>

<p>It is a condition of things hardly to be realized now,
but at that time there was not, to my knowledge, such
a thing as a golf club or a golf ball in the United
States. Canada had its established Clubs and courses
at Quebec and Montreal. Probably somewhere, in
secret places, some few Scots were pursuing their
national pastime, on very "natural" courses, in the
States too: it is impossible to think that it must not
have been so. But probably their sanity was shrewdly
doubted, and they did not court the public eye. As
for "natural" courses, the whole boundless prairies
at certain seasons invite the knocking of the golf ball
about on them.</p>

<p>On this my second visit to America it had been
suggested, I think by Mr. "Bob" Purdey, with whom
I stayed near Meadowbrook, on Long Island, that I
should bring some clubs over and show the people
what sort of a game golf was. But I went first to
Mexico and subsequently to California, leaving the
clubs in New York the while, and when I came back
sundry members of the Meadowbrook Club turned out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
on a certain Sunday to see me give an exhibition
show. We cut some holes in the soil, probably with
carving knives, and I proceeded to instruct them,
by precept and example, as to what golf meant. I
cannot think that my exposition was very effective.
They did not seem to think that it meant very much.
They tried shots for themselves, and the result of
those trials was not such as to give them a very exalted
opinion of golf. The most favourable criticism that
I can recall was that "it might be a good game for
Sundays." I do not think it was extravagant praise.</p>

<p>I believe that was the first time golf was ever played
in the States, though there may, of course, have been
these secret Scots, as I have said. However, the Meadowbrook
people were so far impressed as to ask
me to send them out some clubs, when I got back&mdash;which
I did, from the shop of Peter Paxton, then at
Eastbourne. But what became of those clubs I never
heard. Neither they nor my excellent example inspired
America with golfing zeal. That great country
had to wait before awaking to a true sense of the
merits of the great game. But time has its revenges
and the awakening has come. Also, at the moment
of writing, it has the effect of making England conscious
that she must "Wake up"; for that twenty-year-old
Mr. Ouimet has just taken the American
championship, in a manner that has made history,
out of what seemed the securely holding hands of
either Ray or Vardon.</p>

<p>I think it was in 1888, soon after I came back
from America, that I had my first match of any public
note with Johnny Laidlay. I think it was the Town
Council or some other people anxious to attract
golfers to North Berwick&mdash;is it conceivable now that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
there should be a desire to attract more?&mdash;that gave
some prizes for a scratch tournament open to all
amateurs. Johnny Laidlay persuaded me to enter
(he was my host for the occasion), and he gave me a
good hammering in the final bout. For we both
survived till the final, and I remember that, starting
out, we both played badly enough for a hole or two.
Then I lighted a pipe and smoked it, and it is a sign
of how times have changed that one of the Scottish
papers, commenting on the match, said, "At this point
Mr. Hutchinson lit a pipe and smoked it and actually
did not remove it from his mouth while playing the
strokes&mdash;a thing never seen before in a big match."
That seems queer comment at this time of day, when
the incense of tobacco curls perpetually upward from
the pipe of champion Ray and when the cigarette
of Harold Hilton is like the fire that is never quenched.
But the soothing of the nerves and accuracy of game
that I had hoped to follow from the lighting of that
particular pipe did not ensue. Mr. Laidlay found his
game, while I was still looking vainly for mine, and
he hammered me, if I remember right, pretty easily.
The reporters were fairly out after me that day. They
criticised the pipe unfavourably, and then one of
them recorded a painful incident of the game in the
following terse and pregnant sentence: "Here Mr.
Hutchinson broke his niblick, his favourite club."
I do not know whether this literary gentleman had seen
me in bunkers and niblicking out of them so frequently
that he inferred the niblick to be the club
that I most loved to have in hand; at all events,
that was his comment, and it went home. I think
they must have had a golfing reporter at this time with
a vein of ironic humour about him, for it was then, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
nearly then, that one of them wrote about Captain
Willy Burn: "Here the Captain hit one of his
characteristic shots&mdash;far into the whins!" Whether
it all was irony or innocence we did not know, for
this commentator did his good work by stealth and we
never found him out.</p>

<p>I was in no way surprised at losing that match with
Mr. Laidlay, especially at North Berwick, where he
was very strong. But I did lose a match about this
time which I had not thought of losing, and by its
loss did a little towards the making of golfing history.
All history is curiously made. The coming of a little
sandy-haired boy from Northam village to do the
work that an odd boy does about our house near
Northam village is not an incident that looks big with
history, but when the little boy's name is known to
be J.H. Taylor, the historical importance becomes
evident. He left that "odd boy" work and went as
a gardener's assistant, where, for a short while, we
lost sight of him. But then he was put on as an
assistant on the Westward Ho! links in aid of Sowden,
the old Californian Forty-niner, who looked after
the green, or left it to look after itself. We passed
the time of day with him, quite as if we were his
equals, with no notion of his future greatness. Then
the Northam village players (I hardly know whether
their Club was formally instituted by that date) said
they would like to play the Royal North Devon
Club a match. I was put to play Taylor. I did not
think much about the job. I had hardly seen him
play a stroke before. Going to the very first hole I
remember a shot of his with a cleek: it went low;
I thought he had half topped it; but it continued
going. It had seemed certain to fall into the bunker<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
guarding the green. But it carried that bunker and
lay close to the hole. Again and again I found the
same deceptive low-flying shot going a great deal
further than I had expected it to. I began to realize
then that it was because of his stance, with the ball
so very far back towards his right. I also began to
realize that I was a hole or two down. I did not play
well; really, at that date, I ought to have beaten
him. But he was one up with four to play, and then
I laid him a stimy. He had two for the half. But
instead of putting round, as all ordinary men of experience
would, he tried to loft, for the hole, with his
ordinary&mdash;and his only&mdash;flat iron. He just failed:
but he holed the next putt, though he was not dead.
Finally he beat me&mdash;I think at the last hole&mdash;and I
congratulated him, as in duty bound, adding that
when he knew a little more he would not be trying to
loft stimies when he was one up and had two for the
half. So I said, thinking to be wise, whereas it was
I really who did not know&mdash;not knowing of what
Taylor even then, and even with a flattish iron, was
capable in the way of putting stop on the ball.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<h4>HOW I LOST THE CHAMPIONSHIP AND
PLAYED THE MOST WONDERFUL SHOT IN
THE WORLD</h4>


<p>In 1888 I lost the amateur championship at Prestwick,
and I lost it badly. I do not mean by that
that I lost it to a bad player. It was Andy Stuart
who knocked me out, and for his game I have always
had a high respect. But I do not think that either
of us played very well in that match. I know that
I did not. For one thing (or for two things) I topped
two tee-shots running, and one of them was going to
the "Himalayas Coming In," which, as all who know
Prestwick will realize, is not a good place to choose
for a tee-shot "along the carpet." He was three up
and five to play, and I worried him down to one up
and two to play, but he did the seventeenth hole better
than I and finished by laying me a stimy. But I
do not think I should have holed the putt anyhow&mdash;I
was by no means dead&mdash;and at all events he won the
hole and so the match.</p>

<p>And then the next morning, when he was stropping
his razor, he cut his hand so severely that it was against
the doctor's advice that he played at all, but play he
did, and seeing that he was far from his best by reason
of this damaged hand and that it was Johnny Ball that
he had to play, it is no great wonder that he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
defeated; and he had all my sympathy. He had
my sympathy by reason both of his damaged hand and
of his defeat, but still I did think that if he were going
to cut his hand at all, it would have been as well that he
should have done so the morning before. In that
case I, and not he, might have been up against Johnny
on the morrow.</p>

<p>I have no reason to look back on that match with
pride, but I remember it with special interest, because
it had one of the most extraordinary incidents in it
that ever did happen in any match at golf. And this
notable incident was as follows. Going to the hole
after the Himalayas going out, which was much the
same then as it is now, save that the green was not
levelled up and that the tee-shot probably did not
run as far, I sliced my second very badly, right over
the hillocks on the right of the green. I went over the
ridge, with my caddie, to play the ball, and pitched it
over, with a loft, to the place where I thought the green
to be. Then I ran up to the top of the ridge, and
looked, but could see no ball. I asked then, as I
came down over the ridge, where the ball was. There
was a small concourse of perhaps a score of spectators.
"Oh," they said, "the ball has not come over."
"Not come over!" I repeated, filled with astonishment.
"Why, I know it has!" As a matter of fact
it had been lofted high into the air and both I and the
caddie had seen it with the most perfect distinctness.
Still, it appeared that it was not there; it almost
seemed as if the ordinary operations of Nature's laws
had been suspended and the solid gutty had been dissolved
into thin air in mid flight.</p>

<p>Then, as we all were looking about, in much surprise,
a man spoke up. He was a Mr. Kirk, a townsman of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
St. Andrews and a fine golfer. He took part in the
first amateur championship when it was played at
St. Andrews, but he had come to this one as a spectator
only. He said, "Well&mdash;I did think I felt a tug
at my pocket." (By this time we all were very much
intrigued to imagine what could have happened to the
ball.) And at that he looked into the outside breast
pocket of his coat; and there the ball lay, on his handkerchief,
like an egg in a nest.</p>

<p>Has a more wonderful thing ever happened at golf?
I, at all events, have never heard of any more extraordinary
series of small marvels ever taking place.
In the first instance it was wonderful enough that the
ball should thus plump down so cleanly and neatly
into the pocket at all; then that none of the score
or so of watchers should have seen it; next, that not
even the man into whose pocket it thus plumped
should have noticed it as it came down, imperilling his
very nose and eyes; and, finally, that it should have
landed so gently that he did not actually realize that
anything had struck him&mdash;only "fancied he felt
something tug at his pocket." Naturally, if it were
not for the cloud of witnesses, I should never have
ventured to tell the tale. My own character, if I
have any, for veracity is not nearly high enough to
stand such a strain.</p>

<p>These are the facts; and then of course arose the
question as to what should be done with the ball.
As it happened, it did not arise in a form very acute,
because Andy Stuart was well on the green in two and
I, in Mr. Kirk's pocket, standing on the edge of the
green, in three. We agreed finally that the pocket
should be emptied where the pocketer stood, and from
there I played out the hole and lost it. It is almost a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
question whether such a shot as this did not deserve
to win the hole.</p>

<p>Curiously enough the only other golfer I ever knew
who played a ball into a man's pocket is Andy Stuart
himself. He hit a full drive right into the coat tail
pocket of Lord Lee, the Scottish Lord of Session.
But his lordship was very far from being unaware,
like Mr. Kirk, of the pocketing. He was quite painfully
aware of it. As Andy was at that time at the
Scottish Bar, it seems to me that it was a very injudicious
stroke for him, as a rising young advocate, to
play.</p>

<p>The curiosities of that great shot of mine are not
exhausted yet. For a full quarter of a century I
told that story, saying that not a soul had seen the
ball come over the hill, and that, but for Mr. Kirk
bethinking himself of the fancied tug at his pocket,
I should have had to treat that ball as lost. And
then, one day when I was waiting before the Clubhouse
at Biarritz, there came up to me one whom I
knew by sight only, Colonel Von Donop, of the Royal
Engineers. He introduced himself, using as the
medium of introduction that stroke and that ball.
It appears that he, though I had not known it all those
years, had been standing further along the ridge at a
point whence he could see both me as I played the
shot on the one side and the little crowd of spectators
on the other. He saw the ball rise into the air,
and also saw it drop, as he thought even at the time,
into a spectator's pocket. He also saw the discussion
and the search which took place when I came over the
hill, and when I replied with some indignation to the
statement that the ball had not gone over also. He
was just about to come forward to explain what he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
had seen when Mr. Kirk found the ball and the incident
terminated. It was the last and crowning act
in the curious comedy, that I should discover, twenty-five
years later, and in the south of France, that there
had been an unsuspected spectator of that funny little
episode in the West of Scotland.</p>

<p>Johnny Ball, thus defeating Andy Stuart, found
himself in the final face to face with that very frequent
foe, in this and after years, Johnny Laidlay. The
latter had been playing very finely: he had won a
tournament with a good entry at Carnoustie, and had
picked up many medals in the Lothians, but he could
not hold Johnny Ball in that final. The Sassenach
seemed to have the better of the match all the way and
won quite comfortably. The Hoylake folk had comfort
at length in the long deferred fulfilment of
their great hopes for the local hero, and certainly
they have not to complain that he has disappointed
them since.</p>

<p>There was something very attractive about the
Prestwick golf at that time. Nor has it lost that special
attraction since. The West of Scotland did not then,
nor does it now, take the same general interest in golf
as the East, but there was a very zealous and very
friendly society of golfers belonging to the Prestwick
club. It was the country of the Houldsworths, the iron
people, who took the keenest interest in golf. Mr.
William Houldsworth, known as Big Bill, was most
kind to me when I was a boy at Westward Ho! He
made frequent pilgrimages to that green. He was my
first host at Prestwick, at his house of Mount Charles,
some miles out, and I think looked on it as some
disgrace that, coming from his house, I should lose the
championship. At Prestwick itself too, looking out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
on the fourteenth green, lived Mr. Whigham, the
father of a family of great golfers, both the brothers
and the sisters. And about the whole course there
was, and still is, an air of friendliness. It is not great
golf, but it is exceedingly pleasant golf and also it is
exceedingly difficult golf. In the days of the "gutty"
ball it was great, as well as good, golf, but the golf
there has never, to me, worn the very business-like
aspect of the East Coast golf. I do not say that it is
any the worse for that&mdash;on the contrary. It lies in a
district of more kindly climate and more rich pasturage
than the East, and I remember one open championship
there when Willie Fernie, always a fellow with a ready
jest, came in humorously lamenting that he had lost
his ball twice "on the putting green." It was a
sad grassy year that season, and if you might not
actually lose the ball on the putting green itself,
you might, and you did, spend many a minute in search
for it only just off the green. No mowing could overtake
the growth. And of course Prestwick has all the
picturesqueness of the Clyde estuary&mdash;the Kyles of
Bute, Arran and the rest of the professional natural
beauties of that coast&mdash;for its setting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h4>JOHNNY BALL AND JOHNNY LAIDLAY</h4>


<p>I have not said very much, or not as much as the
subject deserves, about Johnny Ball as a golfer;
have not attempted any appreciation of his game.
He would not, as I have indicated already before,
do himself any kind of justice at the beginning of his
career, when he was off his native Hoylake heath,
and this failure was a source of bitter disappointment
to his friends at home. They began to be afraid
whether he ever would make that mark which they
knew his golfing talents ought to put within his achievement.
They need not have feared.</p>

<p>So now that I have brought the course of this faithful
history to the point at which he and the Scottish
Johnny&mdash;Laidlay&mdash;came together in the final of the
amateur championship, it seems as if both of them had
at length "arrived." They have set their names
on the scroll of Fame and will grave them constantly
deeper as the years go. The one, to be sure, was
destined to perform many more deeds of glory than
the other, and the English Johnny to win a big balance
of their matches, but they were in constant competition
with one another, and for four successive years
at this time one or other of them was amateur champion.
It was not indeed until after that great tournament
had been going for six years that another name
than theirs and my own was inscribed on the
championship cup.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>I may have suffered&mdash;probably I have&mdash;under many
illusions with regard to my ability to play golf, but I
never so deluded myself as to suppose I was as good a
player as Johnny Ball. I believe I am right in thinking
that Johnny Laidlay has just the same opinion
of him, in comparison with himself. He, too, I believe,
would put Johnny Ball on a pedestal by himself, and
leave him there, as the best match-player that we
ever have had among the amateurs. I say match-player
with deliberation, for of all amateurs by far the
best score-player that we have seen is, in my judgment
(and I cannot believe that anyone is likely to
think differently), Johnny Ball's younger schoolfellow
at Hoylake, Harold Hilton. But of course his is
rather a younger story, and so, too, is that of Jack
Graham, another Hoylake prodigy, of Freddy Tait,
of Bobby Maxwell and others. Still, I make no exception
of any of those later ones when I claim that
Johnny Ball is the best amateur that has ever been
seen, for a match. It did not need that he should
win the open championship and the amateur championship
eight times, in order to prove this. I knew
it well, even before he ever won either championship
once.</p>

<p>It has always amused me, as it has amused Johnny
Laidlay too (we have compared notes about it), to
hear people in some of these latter years saying, as
Johnny Ball won championship after championship,
that "he is as good as he ever was." But the one who
has always been most of all amused by these statements
is Johnny Ball himself. Perhaps the most
humorous thing about it is that they are invariably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
statements made by those who never saw Johnny
Ball at all when he really was at his best. Those who
did see him then know better than to make them.</p>

<p>I know that I never started out to play a match with
Johnny Ball without the full consciousness that if we
both played our game I was bound to be beaten, or,
rather, that it could only be by an accident if I should
win. It is a feeling I have never had, when I was
playing tolerably well, with any other amateur,
except when playing Bobby Maxwell over Muirfield.
But then I cannot pretend that I was playing at all
as strongly as I once might have played when I had to
encounter that great man. Still I do not suppose I
could ever have held him at Muirfield. He was not
quite as terrible elsewhere.</p>

<p>Curiously enough I have had rather the better of the
exchanges, in the so-called "big" matches, amateur
championship matches, and the like, that I have
played with Johnny Ball. He would sometimes miss
a short putt&mdash;in fact, I always rated him as good for a
couple of missed short putts in the round&mdash;and that
just gave one a chance to come in. But as to
"friendly" matches&mdash;though I am sorry to say I have
had but few with him&mdash;I think he has beaten me
every one. It is true they were always on his native
Hoylake. With Johnny Laidlay, on the other hand,
of whom I never had the same consciousness of being
in the hands of a stronger man as I had with the
English Johnny, I have had the worse of it in the
"big" matches. I beat him, I remember, in an
international match, but he beat me at least twice
in the amateur championship, and I have not a win
from him to my score in that encounter. Yet in the
"friendly" matches&mdash;and we have played a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
many, for I have very often been the guest of his
kind hospitality, both at North Berwick and elsewhere&mdash;I
do not think that I have come off at all
the worse.</p>

<p>But Johnny Ball, at his best, and especially at
Hoylake, was a terror. For one thing he was so
very long. Generally driving with a hook, the ball
carried very far and then set to work to run till it
made you tired watching it. And then he had that
wonderful long approach with his brassey, banging
the ball right up to the hole, with a concave
trajectory&mdash;you know what I mean&mdash;the ball starting
low and rising towards the end of its flight, then
dropping nearly perpendicularly, and with no run.
It is a shot that I have seen played in any perfection
only by three players, and all young ones&mdash;Johnny
Ball, Hugh Kirkaldy and Jamie Allan. Only the
first is still alive, and he does not, probably cannot,
play the stroke now. I believe it is a stroke that was
easier with the gutta-percha balls than with the
modern rubber-hearted things. At all events no one
plays the stroke now. Perhaps that foolishly named
"push-stroke" of Vardon's comes most near to it,
and now and again Taylor gives us something of the
sort: but this is with iron clubs, not with wood.
In the old days Bob Ferguson had the stroke, with
his irons, played up to the plateaux greens at North
Berwick with great accuracy; but he did not achieve
it so well with the wood.</p>

<p>Then Johnny could drive that gutta-percha ball
most ferociously with his cleek. I remember Colonel
Hegan Kennard saying to him, as he and I were
playing a match, "I wish you could teach me to drive
as far with my driver as you can with your cleek."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Johnny had just driven a huge cleek shot to the
end hole. And Kennard was a very fair scratch
player of the day. Johnny was full of resource too.
When you had him, as you thought, in a tight place,
he would bring off some <i>tour de force</i>, with a great
hook or slice, and lose very little. He delighted, too,
in an evil and windy day: the harder it blew the
better he could play and the more he enjoyed controlling
his ball through the storm.</p>

<p>The short game was where he gave you your chances.
If you could live with him at all through the green
and up to the hole you need not despair of stealing
a shot or two back from him, now and then, on, and
from just off, the putting green.</p>

<p>And that was the very last point at which you might
think to have any advantage over that other, the Scottish
Johnny. He never could quite trust his wooden
clubs. The occasional hook or slice was apt to put
in a sudden appearance, after he had been playing
perfectly straight for a number of holes. On the
putting green he improved very much after I had
known him for a year or two. But always, from first
to last in a golfing career which has been crammed
full of glorious achievement, once he came within
ironing reach of the green there was no man, till Taylor
came, that was his equal. That is my humble opinion.
Bob Ferguson, who was really his teacher, on that fine
old nine-hole course at Musselburgh, may have been
even better at the full iron bangs up to the hole:
he had the concave flight and the straight drop which
are worth anything in the approach; but Johnny
Laidlay was better than his master at the little chip
shots. He learned them, no doubt, at North Berwick,
where you are undone, if you cannot play them, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
where the other man is undone if you can. And, then,
Johnny Laidlay was a very fine finisher in a tight match.
How many times I have known him do that last hole
at North Berwick in three&mdash;a hole hardly to be reached
from the tee and guarded by a very tricky valley&mdash;when
the match depended on it I should be sorry
to say. I always thought his stance, as he addressed
his ball all "off the left leg," an ungraceful one, and
am inclined to think it the cause of the occasional
uncertainty of his driving, but his manipulation,
by which I mean his hand and finger work, of his
iron clubs was beautifully delicate. I do not think
he had given much thought to the way in which the
different strokes were played&mdash;the slice and the pull
and the rest of them&mdash;but there was not, so far as I
know, a stroke or a subtlety with the iron clubs that
he was not master of. His clubs were all curiously
thin in the grip, and one of his great theories was that
the club should be held as lightly as possible. There
is not a doubt that most men can put more cut on the
ball with a lightly than with a tightly held club,
but further than that, there is not any very general
recognition, so far as I know, of a virtue in the light
grip.</p>

<p>After I lost the amateur championship at Prestwick
in 1888, these two Johnnies, the English and the
Scottish, held it between them, winning two apiece
for four years, so that it was not until Mr. Peter
Anderson won, in the seventh year of its institution,
that we let it go out of the hands of one of the three.
Neither Johnny Laidlay nor I were fated to win again,
but as for the other Johnny, there seems to be no saying
when he will be done with it. To be sure he has a
few years' advantage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<h4>A CHAPTER OF ODDS AND ENDS</h4>


<p>In 1886 my father took a house at Eastbourne,
and I was no longer at Westward Ho! as constantly
as before, although a frequent visitor there at
the house of Claud Carnegie. He and I used to have
many matches on terms that are rather to be commended
as a means for bringing together two players
of different handicaps. We used to play level, but
I had to give him five shillings before starting and at
the end he paid me back a shilling for every hole
that I was up. It came, of course, to the same thing
as giving five holes up, but it is rather a more amusing
way of stating these odds. The five shillings puts me
in mind of a very much more gambling match that
was played about that time, when I was at Hoylake.
There was at that date a very festive company of
Edinburgh golfers going about the various links
under the leadership of old Mr. Robert Clark, who
edited the great book on golf. There was Sir Walter
Simpson, who also wrote a great golf book and was
the son of the doctor who discovered the blessed uses
of chloroform, Hall Blyth, Valentine Haggard, Cathcart,
Jack Innes, and a few more&mdash;all, I fear, except
Hall Blyth, gone over to the majority.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Five of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
these warriors started out one day at Hoylake to
play a five-ball match, for a fiver a hole, and&mdash;this
was the prudent stipulation of Mr. Robert Clark,
in his ancient wisdom&mdash;they were to settle up at the
end of each hole. The man who happened to fall into
bad trouble would thus have to part with four fivers
on the putting green, so it must have needed a well-filled
notebook to make a man sure of living through
to the finish without bankruptcy. I had suggested
that a six-ball match would be really more fun than
a five-ball, and that I was willing to make the sixth;
but the well-meant suggestion was not taken in good
part. I forget the ultimate result of the encounter.</p>

<p>Naturally I was at Eastbourne a good deal, as I
had no other home than my father's, and I arrived
just at the time of the first laying out of the original
nine-hole course there. Mayhewe was the most active
of its originators, and he and I planned it together.
It implies no reflection on the designers of the later
eighteen-hole course to say that the old nine-holes
were better than any of the later developments.
It is a very different problem laying out nine, and laying
out eighteen holes on almost the same circumscribed
piece of ground; for the later additions to the
area do not amount to a great deal.</p>

<p>It is amazing to me now to think how ignorant we
were in those days of the proper treatment of inland
putting greens. We could plan the rest of the course
well enough. But the great idea was to keep on rolling
and rolling and rolling&mdash;the heavier the roller the
better&mdash;until we had the surface just round the
hole so slick that if there was any gradient at all the
ball would not stay near the hole even if you placed it
there by hand. There was (there still is) a green called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
"Paradise"&mdash;and no green was ever named more
aptly according to the classic principle of <i>lucus a non
lucendo</i>. If you were below the hole, and below it on
this green you were sure to be, because the ball would
not rest above, you might putt up to the hole, and if
you missed the hole the ball would come trickling
down to you again, and so you might go on putting
"till the cows came home." By which time there
might probably be a little dew which possibly might
allow your ball to come to rest in the hole's vicinity.
But long before that you would have come to the
conclusion that golf, on Paradise green, was not a
good game. One device used to be to cut some jagged
raw edges to stick out on the ball's surface, before
driving off the tee for this hole. Thus jagged, the ball
would not fly properly, but it was better to lose a shot,
owing to this jaggedness, through the green, than to
lose twenty on the putting green. On the rough
edges of its scars the ball would come to rest even in
Paradise.</p>

<p>However, this is a picture of that green at its most
grievous worst. It was not always thus, and on the
whole the course, with its drives over a great chalk
pit and over the corners of one or two high woods,
gave us great fun and was not a bad test of golf. Peter
Paxton was the professional, a humorous little fellow
and a wonderful putter on those tricky greens. I
remember, when he sent us his credentials, he added
the comment "and, Sir, I drink nothing stronger than
cold water." I liked the "cold," as if he feared that
water with the chill off might go to his head. He grew
braver later.</p>

<p>This course at Eastbourne, be it understood, was
technically of the "inland" kind, though at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
seaside. It was of the chalk-down soil; and it was
among the first of the new supply of inland courses
which the ever spreading vogue of golf demanded.
Still we looked on these inland greens as giving
us at best only a poor substitute for the real game.
We had yet to learn of what inland soil, cleverly
treated with an eye to golf, might be capable. The
only inland Club which was at this time of any weight
in the general golfing councils was the Royal Wimbledon,
which had seceded from the London Scottish,
building itself a club-house at the opposite end of the
common. Some of the golfing leaders of the day, such
as Henry Lamb and Purves and others, made this
their headquarters, and there they were already
hatching schemes which were ultimately to lead to
all that great development of golf in the East Neuk,
so to say, of Kent, and at first were to take form in
the St. George's Club and links, at Sandwich. Purves,
with characteristic, energy, was scouring the coast of
England in these years, looking for links as by Nature
provided, and it was here, at this point, that he had
his great success. Of course there was much palaver
and indecision, as well as prolonged negotiations with
the landowner&mdash;or his trustees, seeing that Lord
Guildford was then a minor&mdash;before any real move
could be made; but when it was made it meant a
very great deal for London golfers and gave an immense
drive forward to the already fast booming boom of
English golf. In 1886 Mr. Du Maurier, the <i>Punch</i>
artist, was at St. Andrews, already, as I remember,
in large goggles and having trouble with his eyes, and
he then drew a picture of "the Golf Stream," as he
called it&mdash;a succession of pilgrims of all sorts, sexes
and sizes, making their way to St. Andrews. Will it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
be believed that this was the first golfing picture in
<i>Punch</i>; that it was the very first mention, as I think,
of golf in a comic paper? What would <i>Punch</i> do
to-day, we may ask with wonder and dismay, if all
the humorous opportunities which golf gives its
artists and its writers were withdrawn from them?
They would feel impoverished indeed. A year or
two later, when I was editing the Badminton Book
on Golf, Mr. Harry Furniss showed me a letter he had
just received from Mr. Frank Burnand, then staying
at Westward Ho! and then editing <i>Punch</i>. Harry
Furniss was, and is, a golfer; Frank Burnand was not.
"I think you would like this place," wrote the
author of <i>Happy Thoughts</i>&mdash;"there are fine golfing
sands (<i>sic</i>) here." Therein he expressed an even
happier thought than he knew, for Westward Ho!
at that moment happened to be suffering from a considerable
drought, and a heavy gale had scattered the
dry sand far and wide out of the bunkers, so that
"golfing sands" gave rather an apt description.</p>

<p>The Badminton Library of Sport was then coming
out, volume by volume, and delighting all to whom
Sports and Pastimes made appeal. I do not wish
to bring too great discredit on a very eminent firm
of publishers, but it is a fact, sad as it is true, that
when I first waited on them, obedient to their summons,
in Paternoster Row, and they broached to
me the subject of a golf book in their series, they made
the very shocking suggestion that it should be included
in the same volume with other Scottish sports,
such as skating, curling and perhaps tossing the
caber. They did not know, they said, when I met
them with some mild expostulation, whether the
game was "of sufficient importance to carry a volume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
to itself." I must do them the justice to say that
they quickly saw and repented of their error, and I
believe that ultimately the golf volume did better
than any other in all that popular series.</p>

<p>While I was doing some of the writing for this book,
Sir Ralph Payne Galway was writing the Shooting
volumes, and we were both staying with poor John
Penn at his house in Carlton House Terrace. One
night John Penn asked Mr. Purdey, the gun-maker,
to dinner, to talk guns with Sir Ralph; and these two
sat long over the dessert, after the rest of us had left
the table, talking of loads and bores and so on. The
next morning, while we were at breakfast, a four-wheeler
drove up to the door, and Sir Ralph, looking
out, said in dismay, "By Jove, John, I believe that
under the influence of your champagne I must have
ordered a whole 'bus load of guns from Purdey." We
looked out, and the four-wheeler was filled, from roof
to floor, with guns. It appeared, however, that they
were not all on order, but had merely been sent round
by Mr. Purdey for inspection. This, however, is not
golf; nor was Sir Ralph then, I think, a golfer, in
spite of the good service he has since rendered to the
dynamics of the golf stroke and in spite of the
excellence of the "P.G." ball.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<h4>A MORE LIBERAL POLICY AT ST. ANDREWS</h4>


<p>In those days Professor Tait used to be a great deal
at St. Andrews, in the intervals, which were wide,
of his professional duties in Edinburgh. He used to
play a round of golf, generally by himself, generally
talking to the ball all the time, as if asking it why it
behaved as it did, and very frequently laughing at
it&mdash;for he was essentially a laughing philosopher&mdash;long
before the ordinary golfer had his breakfast.
Six o'clock, it was said, was his hour for starting,
and the rest of the day, when he came back, he had
at his own command for study, of which he did an
enormous amount, for tobacco, of which he consumed
a mighty deal, and for chaff and talk, of which he was
most genially fond. He was a lover of humanity,
and not even the biggest fool on the links (which is a
liberal order) was made conscious of his folly when
it came up against the Professor's learning. He
used to let me come into his laboratory in Edinburgh,
and in return used to employ me in driving balls
at a revolving plate of clay and all sorts of experiments.</p>

<p>Poor young Freddie was not yet of the stature
to drive very fiercely, though he was already fiercely
keen. He was at school at Sedbergh, in Yorkshire,
where Fred Lemarchand, who had been at Oxford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
with me, was a master. Lemarchand putted the
weight for the University, being a very strong fellow,
and developed into a very useful golfer. And he,
apparently, made it his business to get "rises" out
of young Freddie, telling him in chaff that the Scots
did not know how to play golf: that Johnny Ball
and I were better than their best amateurs, and so
on. I have always wondered whether this chaff helped
to incite Freddie to become the great golfer that he
was. Golf, to be sure, was bred in him&mdash;his eldest
brother Jack was a fine player&mdash;but perhaps Lemarchand's
chaff gave him an added zeal. I remember
him first as a stalwart, very cheery little boy hitting
a ball about with very slight respect for human life
or limb.</p>

<p>It was about this time that I moved a resolution
at a general meeting of the Royal and Ancient Club
that their local rules, such as that touching the dreary
palisaded cabbage patch magniloquently styled the
Stationmaster's Garden, should be taken out of the
body of the rules and be printed under a separate
heading, in order that the many Clubs which were
being established in divers places might adapt more
easily for their own use the rules capable of universal
employment, and might make their own separate
local rules besides. This was passed, and was a useful
move for those other Clubs, which heretofore had
included in their own rules regulations dealing with a
Stationmaster's Garden, a railway and other "amenities"
which had no existence at all on their courses.</p>

<p>And a little later a Committee, of which I was a
member, was appointed under Lord Kingsburgh to
revise and amend the rules. We worked hard at the
job and evolved something that we thought very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
admirable, whereupon Sir Alexander Kinloch, on the
presentation of our work to the general meeting of
the Club, proposed "that the Committee be thanked
for their labours and that the result be put into the
fire." I think if it had been any other than Sir Alexander
that had brought forward the proposal we
should have been very angry, but we all knew him
and liked him too well to mind. He was rather a
specially licensed person with a knack of putting things
into words which might give offence if anyone chose
to take it. "What's the good," he said once, to
another general meeting, "of all this talk about
first-class players? There are only three first-class
amateurs, Johnny Ball, Johnny Laidlay and Horace
Hutchinson." That is as it may be; but evidently
it was not a remark that was likely to be received with
universal favour.</p>

<p>Sir Alexander, father of the present baronet, Sir
David, and also of Frank,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the writer on golf, was
not a first-class player by any means, but he had all
the qualities that are connoted by that phrase which
was much more often heard then than now&mdash;a "first-rate
partner in a foursome." He was one of those
who liked his caddie to point out to him the line of
the putt. Taylor, the one-armed man, who became
the caddie-master at St. Andrews later, used to
carry for him, and there is a picture of him in the
Badminton Book showing the line. We used to be
allowed to do a great deal in the way of brushing
loose impediments, often more imaginary than real,
out of the line with the club: there was no rule
against the caddies indicating the line by a club<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
laid right down on that line, and a cunning caddie
would often select the roughest spot on the line on
which to lay it&mdash;with the result that when the club
was lifted again that spot was just a little less rough
than it had been before. Some of these good old
"partners in a foursome" were not at all pleased when
the rule was so changed that the caddie was not permitted
to touch the line in giving this indication. At
first the modification was only to the extent of
requiring that the line should be pointed out only by
the end of the shaft of the club, and not by the head,
but this too was liable to abuse, for the effect often
was to leave a little mark on the turf, which served
as a guide for the eye.</p>

<p>I do not know whether our general recommendations
regarding the rules were actually consumed by fire,
as advised by Sir Alexander Kinloch, but at all events
they were not passed. They were remitted back
to Lord Kingsburgh, as a committee of one, to revise,
and he brought them back with one only, so far as I
know, modification of importance. It was a modification
of great importance to the slow player and
the short driver, and probably is largely responsible
for the modern congestion of greens. It is also responsible,
no doubt, for the saving of some lives; but
they would be, at best, the lives of short drivers, who,
perhaps, do not matter. There used, even of old,
to be a rule that parties behind should not drive off
the tee until those in front had played their seconds.
Obviously this put people who could drive only a
hundred and fifty yards very much at the mercy
of others coming behind who could drive two hundred
yards. In the new version of the rules, according to
Lord Kingsburgh, the parties behind had to wait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to drive off, not only till those in front had played
their seconds, but also until they were out of range.
Manifestly that gave the shorter drivers a much
better chance for their lives. At the same time it delivered
the longer drivers behind right into their hands.
They could be as slow as they pleased, and had no fear,
under the law, of being harassed by those who came
after them. Lord Kingsburgh himself was a short
driver, and of course sympathized with his kind.
I imagine he made golfing life much more pleasant
for himself for the remainder of his days by this enactment.
For his version, which altered the old in hardly
any other respect than this, was passed by the meeting.
There were more short drivers than there are
now, in the days of the solid "gutty" ball.</p>

<p>The best of the players more or less resident at St.
Andrews in the later eighties were Leslie Balfour,
Jim Blackwell (it was extraordinary to what extent
he lost his game after a residence of some years in
South Africa), Mure Ferguson, Andy Stuart and David
Lamb. Leslie I have always regarded as one of the
soundest golfers I ever met. "If you're playing your
best you'll beat him, but if you're playing anything
below your best he'll beat you." This used to be
Johnny Laidlay's verdict on him, and it always seemed
to me to express the reliable quality of Leslie's game
very well. I cannot but think that Mure Ferguson
became a better golfer in the later years than he was
in these early days at St. Andrews, but it is rather
difficult for me to do justice to the great game that
he had in him because he seldom happened to play
his best against me. I have seen him play great
matches. In the amateur championship at Hoylake
he was in the final with Johnny Ball, and though that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
champion of champions was four up at one moment
of the match, Mure had him square with two holes
to go&mdash;a great performance! Then Johnny went
out for a great second shot to the then seventeenth
(now the sixteenth) hole, right across the corner of
the field, and so gained the green with his second; and
that stroke virtually settled the match. Johnny asked
me afterwards if I thought he was right in going for it.
All I had to say was, "Absolutely, if you felt that you
could do it." It all lay in that&mdash;in this confidence
in himself. And no man knows Hoylake distances
better. No doubt Mure was, and even is, a fine match-player,
especially a fine finisher of those few last
holes when the match is to be decided by them. David
Lamb, brother of Henry, who has been often mentioned,
was a great player in his day, but he could not make
much of the game unless all was going right with him.
And the quality of match-playing depends very largely,
as I think, on the ability to make something of the
game (if possible sufficient to avert defeat) when
things are not going kindly. But of all these St.
Andrews' players, just a little the best of the bunch,
in my opinion, was Andy Stuart at that particular
moment. His golfing day was rather a short one, but
few folks realize how great a player he was, when at
his best.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h4>THE FIRST AMATEUR WIN OF THE OPEN
CHAMPIONSHIP
</h4>

<p>In 1889, having, as aforesaid, exhibited to the
Meadowbrook Club, on Long Island, a specimen
of what they were good enough to say "might be a
very good game for Sundays," I returned to Great
Britain a brief while before the amateur championship
and went up to St. Andrews, very short of practice,
to take part in it. The second or third round brought
me up against Johnny Ball, and I put up a very poor
fight against him. He was playing respectably enough&mdash;not
more, for he never has been a real lover of St.
Andrews&mdash;but I know that he had some satisfaction
in thus getting back on me a bit of what was his due.
I know that he had a little of this feeling because
Johnny Laidlay told me that Hilton said to him, as
we started off, "If there is one man that Johnny
Ball would like to beat in the amateur championship,
it's Horace Hutchinson." So he had his wish, by
some four or five holes, and it was at this same championship,
I think, that we first began to have an
idea how sore a trouble Hilton was going to be to us
in the years to come. For he was playing Johnny
Laidlay, who was then at just about the best of his
game&mdash;which is saying much&mdash;and he stuck to Johnny
like a man, though he was hardly more than a boy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and Johnny confessed to me afterwards that he
acquired a great respect for Hilton's play from that
time forward.</p>

<p>Now the outstanding feature of that meeting was,
beyond all possible question, the match between the
two Johnnies, Laidlay and Ball. It was not the
final match, but probably it decided the final result.
They halved the round. Then, setting forth for extra
holes, they halved the first of these&mdash;and not too
creditably, if the truth be told, for I think the figure
was five apiece. But the second hole they both
played like tigers. They had two good tee shots,
Johnny Laidlay's being a yard or two the longer.
So Johnny Ball had to play. He took his cleek.
Now to reach that second hole in those days, when
the ground was not so keen and it was a gutty ball
that had to be dealt with, with an iron club, at all
was no easy matter; but Johnny's shot looked a
beauty. I judged it, as it ran over the gradients,
after pitching, to be as near perfection as a shot could
be, and to be resting very near the hole. Johnny
Laidlay then had to play; he, too, took a cleek; he,
too, played a shot as near perfect, as it seemed to me,
as might be. My only doubt was whether it was
quite strong enough, whether it would quite hold
its way over the undulations, whether it might not
possibly die away, even towards the bunkers on the
left, a little short of the green. I was, as events
proved, wrong in my estimate of both shots. Johnny
Laidlay's had just the strength to take the undulations
at the right curve: it lay on the green quite near the
hole. Johnny Ball's had been a shade too strong:
it had even over-run the green and was in the bunker,
just beyond. Of course that was the end. No doubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
it was a most unlucky shot; no doubt it was a shot
that deserved to win, rather than lose, a championship.
But I do not mean, saying this, to imply that
there was any luck in Johnny Laidlay's winning that
match and that championship. His shot was perfection.
But Johnny Ball's was very perfect too.
It must have been given an unduly running fall.
However, such is golf, and such is life. Then Johnny
Laidlay had to play Leslie Balfour in the final, and
beat him, as he really was likely to do, if both played
their game. Gallant player as Leslie was, Johnny
had all the advantage of the years on his side. Yet
the time was to come, and many years later, when
Leslie actually should win the championship, beating
Johnny in the final, and in a very wonderful manner,
as shall be told in its due place in the story.</p>

<p>Now all this while I have said mighty little about
the open championship, because really the golfing
world in general took little interest enough in it at
that time. It was regarded as virtually an affair
of the professionals. Now and then a few of us amateurs
took part in it, but it was with scarcely an idea
of possible success. And then, all at once, something
happened, in 1890, which put the open championship
within the possible grasp of the amateur, and therewith
the general interest in that great competition
became at once very much more vivid.</p>

<p>Johnny Ball had won the amateur championship
that year at Hoylake, defeating Johnny Laidlay in the
final. My own part in the contest was an ignominious
one, for I allowed myself to be defeated rather weakly
by Johnny Laidlay at the last hole after being one
up with two to play. I missed a short putt at the
last hole, of which the memory is still painful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>I was playing fairly well that year, notwithstanding,
and went to Prestwick for the open championship&mdash;began
by missing a very holable putt at the first
hole and continued in a like vein throughout the
two rounds. So that was the end of me. And then
I, having finished my futile efforts, heard that Johnny
Ball, who was still out, was doing terrible things. I
went out to meet him, and as he reeled off hole after
hole in the right figure it became apparent that "bar
accidents" he was going to do the most terrible thing
that had ever yet been done in golf&mdash;he, as an amateur,
was going to win the open championship. Dr. Purves
was hurrying along at my elbow as we went, with
the gallery, towards the sixteenth hole. "Horace,"
he said to me, in a voice of much solemnity, "this is a
great day for golf." It was.</p>

<p>Johnny was playing with Willy Campbell, poor
Willy Campbell, splendid player, most gallant of
match-fighters, certainly deserving of championship
honours and only missing them on the last occasion
of the championship being played at Prestwick by
one of those fatal accidents, very near home, bar
which, as aforesaid, Johnny Ball was bound to win the
championship of 1890. But poor Willy on that
occasion got heavily bunkered; lost his head a little
and perhaps his temper more than a little. He had
strokes to spare; but he wasted them hammering in
that bunker, and when I came into Charlie Hunter's
shop at Prestwick half an hour later I saw a sad
sight. Willy Campbell was sitting on an upturned
bucket on one side of the door, his caddie had a similar
humble seat on the other side of the door, and both
were weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>This, however, is a digression into a vale of tears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Johnny Ball did not digress into any such vale. He
continued the scoring of the right figures and accomplished
the great feat, for an amateur, of winning
the open championship. It was a win which made a
difference. It seemed at once to bring the open championship
within the practical horizon of the amateur
for all years to come. It had broken a spell. Incidentally
it may be noted that it put Johnny Ball's
name higher than any other's had ever been, for he
held the championship of the amateurs and of the
professionals at the same time.</p>

<p>And what interested me much at the moment was
the attitude of the professionals towards the result.
I had expected that they would feel rather injured
by seeing the championship which they had been
used to regard as theirs going to an amateur. To
my surprise that did not appear to disconcert them
in the least. What they did resent, however, so far
as resentment may be carried within the limits of
perfectly good sportsmanship, was that it should be
won by an Englishman. You see, it was not only
the first time that it had ever been won by any other
than a professional, but also the first time it ever
had been won by any other than a Scot. That
is a fact which will strike the reader with astonishment
now perhaps, when the poor Scots must have
become fairly well inured to Englishmen annexing
the championship. Taylor and Vardon, to say nothing
of Harold Hilton, have taught them to grin and bear
it as best they may. But up to that time a Scot had
ever been open champion of the game of Scotland, and
Scotland did not much like another taking it.</p>

<p>So that was "a great day for golf," as Dr. Purves
had truly said to me. It gave an added interest to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
all further competitions for this open championship;
for what an amateur had once done, it seemed as if
an amateur might do again, and thus the active interest
was no longer confined to the professionals. The
amateurs became at once something more than mere
lookers on. There was only one man who did not seem
to realize that Johnny Ball had done a big thing, and
that was Johnny Ball. A week or so later he was
playing a friendly match at Hoylake, and just as he
was starting a stranger came up to him and said,
"Can you please tell me, is the open champion playing
here to-day?" and Johnny answered, "Yes, I believe
he is." On which the stranger started out at score
over the links in search of this "open champion,"
whom, presumably, he expected to recognize by some
special halo set about his brow if he should come across
him. Willie Park, fine all-round golfer and magnificent
putter, was the previous holder of the championship,
which he had won in 1889 at Musselburgh;
and that was the last occasion on which this open
championship ever was played on that excellent old
nine-hole course. Just at this time the Honourable
Company of Edinburgh Golfers migrated down to
Muirfield, and that green, instead of Musselburgh,
became the third championship arena, the other two,
at that date, being St. Andrews and Prestwick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<h4>GOLF ON THE CONTINENT AND IN THE
CHANNEL ISLANDS</h4>


<p>In 1890 I took rooms in London, near a studio, and
begun the serious study of anatomy and sculpture,
with the idea of taking up sculpture as a profession.
It was an idea which conflicted a good deal
with the whole-souled devotion to golf. But following
an attack of influenza, I went out to Biarritz in the
winter and there found some of the most curious and
amusing golf to be played that a man could meet
with&mdash;up and down immense cliffs, in lies that were
unspeakably bad, and yet, withal, the whole making,
by some extraordinary means, not only an interesting
species of golf, but also a species that has produced
some fine players. Massy was then a boy there, going
out in the sardine boats when he was not at golf, and
thus gaining a perfect indifference to stormy weather
which has been very valuable to him in his after life
at golf. The storms on the Basque coast are not to be
beaten: they are scratch, or even <i>plus</i>, as tempests.</p>

<p>Then Lord Kilmaine gave that Cup for foursome
match competition between Biarritz and Pau, which
has been the occasion of grand fun every year since.
We had a terrific match on the first occasion of its
playing. Eric Hambro and I&mdash;he was only a boy
then, though a big one&mdash;played Johnny Low and poor
Bobby Boreel, for Pau. We were any number of
holes up&mdash;I forget how many, but the result looked a
dead certainty&mdash;and then at one hole we put three
shots running out of bounds. That was the beginning
of our undoing. Hole after hole slipped away, and I
know that it was only by a kindly dispensation of
Providence that we even halved that match, which
we had reckoned as safely in our pockets. And in
playing off the tie, I think (I am not sure) that we were
beaten.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>But the result of these matches mattered little.
What did matter was the admirable fun we had out
of them, the going and coming, to and from Pau and
Biarritz, the entertaining, the mutual compliments,
the eating and drinking. All the amenities of the
match were so pleasant; for, with the foursome
for the cup, was played, at the same time, a team
match, of sides representing the two places. Some
humorous incidents nearly always occurred to make us
all happy. After I married, my wife, walking in the
gallery, would often hear delightful comments on my
play and other qualities, and one or two of the most
pleasant of these were culled in these Pau and Biarritz
matches. On one occasion I had Roller, the old
Surrey cricketer, as my partner. He was not playing
with very great confidence, and my wife overheard one
man in the gallery say to another: "Old Roller
seems a bit nervous, doesn't he?" To which the
other replied, "Well, you'd be nervous, too, if you were
playing with Horace Hutchinson." "Why?" asked
the first man, innocently. "Because he's got such a
devil of a temper" was the reply. That is the sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
comment which it is most unfortunate that a wife
should overhear.</p>

<p>A failing common in our family is that of going
white-haired at a comparatively early age. I began
to put on that "crown of a virtuous life" when I
was no more than sixteen. Partly on that account
I have usually had the credit of being some years older
than I am, and the golfing reporter, with the usual
unconscious humour of his kind, began to write of
me as "the veteran" at the age of thirty-five. One
of the most constant habitu&eacute;s of Biarritz was the
fine old sportsman Mr. Corrance, in his day the best
shot in Norfolk, and, besides, a fine fisherman, billiard
player and expert at all sports and pastimes demanding
quick harmony of hand and eye. In the course of one
of these Pau and Biarritz matches, when I was playing
for the seaside place and we were not going very
strongly, Mr. Corrance found himself walking beside my
wife. He knew her quite well, but for the moment
had forgotten her name, and at once began to discuss
with her the chances of the match. "The mistake is,
you know," he said, "playing Horace Hutchinson.
He was a good player once, a very good player; but
he's too old now"&mdash;I think I was thirty-eight at the
time&mdash;"they ought to have put in a young man."</p>

<p>One of the attractions of returning year by year to
Biarritz was to note the constantly increasing skill
and power of Massy. Just off the green at Biarritz
the course was very loose and gritty. The accurate
approach was most difficult to play. Massy, of his
own genius, had developed the playing of the stroke
very perfectly, and very curiously. He used to swing
the mashie very far back, in proportion to the distance
that the ball had to go, and to let it come back to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
ball very slowly, with very loose wrist. It is a stroke
quite of his own invention, so far as I know, and I never
saw anyone else play it quite in the same way nor as
accurately. And out of the ranks of the Biarritz
caddies came other good and great players, such as
Gassiat and that Daug&eacute; of whom Braid declares that
he can drive a ball to carry as far as his (Braid's) ball
will go with run and all. It seems a large order, but
no doubt this Frenchman is a wonder.</p>

<p>On the way home from Biarritz we used sometimes
to take a rest at other French golfing places, and most
delightful was Dinard, where the course goes out beside
a sparkling sea. It was good golf and beautiful.
And on one occasion we took the Channel Islands on
our way, and there my wife had yet another chance
of hearing pleasant things said of me. Stuart Anderson
was at Jersey. He was son of the English clergyman
whom we have all known at North Berwick. A match
was arranged&mdash;I think with some little money on it,
though I had none&mdash;that I should play him thirty-six
holes; and coming out in the train from St. Heliers
to Gorey, where the links are, my wife heard some one
say to another, discussing the match, "I hope Anderson
beats that fellow Hutchinson; he swaggers so."
However, on that occasion, I escaped the salutary
chastisement. I played fairly steadily, and after a
while Stuart Anderson broke up a little and let me
win pretty easily. The course at Jersey is a worthy
school for those great golfers, the Vardons, Ray and
so on that it has sent out since; but at that time the
one who gave most promise was Renouf. He was not
more than a boy, but he was a demon putter.</p>

<p>I had for caddie at Jersey a very small and very
stolid little boy. Most of the Jersey folk are bi-lingual,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
speaking English and French indifferently, but this
little boy seemed to have no tongue at all; I could
not get a word out of him. But towards the end of
the round there is, or there was, a hole which was just
to be reached by an extra long drive from the tee. I
made a very fine drive to this green, and the ball, as
we came up, proved to be stone dead, just six inches
to the right of the hole. And then this astonishing
little boy did open his mouth, and, still with the solemnity
of a cod-fish on his face, ejaculated this comment
on what was perhaps the very finest stroke I ever
played in my life&mdash;"Too much to the roight!"</p>

<p>It was perfectly just criticism. The shot was "too
much to the roight"&mdash;by six inches, at the end of a
very long drive. Had it not been so, the ball would
have been in the hole. I do not know to this day
whether that little boy was a humourist of the very
finest and dryest&mdash;really of the <i>extra sec</i>&mdash;quality,
or whether he was just the very stupidest thing ever
made in the Channel Islands.</p>

<p>From there we went to Guernsey, where the caddies
were certainly anything but stupid. They were little
girls, bare-legged and bare-headed, but wonderfully
keen and wonderfully pious, for they would make the
sign of the cross over the line of the opponent's putt
to prevent the ball going into the hole. And really
it is extraordinary how difficult it is to putt straight
along a line that has been thus crossed. Guernsey
has a course which is finer in some of its natural qualities
than that of Jersey, yet it does not seem to have
grown a single great golfer, whereas the Jersey soil
seems to bring them up like weeds. It is rather
curious. But the great days of the Jersey professors
had not yet dawned. Harry Vardon was still working<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
in a garden not far from the Gorey links, with dreams,
perhaps, of future glory, but no present achievement.
Massy was picking the ball up with his marvellous
nicety from the loose rubble of the stuff just off the
Biarritz greens, but had not yet gone in the train of
Sir Everard Hambro, my own most kindly host at
Biarritz, to North Berwick. The Scottish golfers had
received the first shock to their national pride, in seeing
the open championship of their own game won by
an Englishman. It had not yet entered into their
astonished heads that it was to be won by invaders
from outside the British Islands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<h4>ABOUT HAROLD HILTON, FREDDY TAIT
AND OTHERS</h4>


<p>What between trying to be sculptor and succeeding
in getting married, I did not pay all the
attention that I should have done to golf in the early
nineties. Hilton was runner-up in the amateur championship,
first to Johnny Laidlay and then to Johnny Ball,
in 1891 and 1892 respectively: so we may regard him as
thoroughly well arrived. In 1893 Mr. Peter Anderson,
at Prestwick, beat Johnny Laidlay in the final for
the amateur championship and so broke up our
triumvirate. I was not there, and know nothing of
the merits of that champion, who soon, on account
of an unfortunate chest weakness, migrated to Australia.
But the amateur championship of 1892 deserves
a special word, because it was played for the first time
at Sandwich. It was a sign of the times, sign of a
generous policy on part of the Scottish clubs, sign of
an extension of the golfing spirit, that this South-country
green was welcomed into the sacred number
of those on which championships should be played.</p>

<p>In that same year, though I was not golfing very
assiduously, I was at North Berwick when the open
championship was played at Muirfield, and had a narrow
escape of winning that open championship. It was
the first year that the competition was extended to an
affair of seventy-two holes, stretching over two days.
Previously, two rounds, or thirty-six holes, had decided
it, and at the end of the first two rounds I astonished
myself and most other people by finding myself heading
all the field. I forget by how many I had the advantage,
but I think it was by two or three strokes. Then,
on the morning of the second day, hitting off from that
first tee at Muirfield, which then was not far out from
the wall, I pulled my very first shot over the garden
wall, and took I forget how many to the hole. But I
remember intimately that this evil start had a baleful
influence against which I struggled in vain; I went
from bad to worse, and what my eventual score was
for the seventy-two holes I do not know.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Really it was rather hard luck: if only they had
deferred that extension of the test, from thirty-six to
seventy-two holes, for one year more I might have
written myself open champion, but it was not to be;
and as it's an ill wind that blows nobody any good,
so that extra day gave Hilton just the opportunity
he wanted. I can see him now as he came up to the
last hole&mdash;I had gone out to meet him hearing that he
had been doing very well&mdash;walking along at top speed,
chatting volubly with his friends, very pleased with
himself, as he well might be, brimful of confidence
and with the smoke trailing up from his cigarette,
even while he was playing the ball, so that it seemed
impossible that he could see through it to hit the
ball correctly. But he did hit it mighty correctly,
for all that, and won the championship. I believe
he did several conjuring tricks during the course of the
round, such as holding mashie pitches from the edge
of the green. But however he did it, he won, and
therewith, from that time forward, established himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
as very distinctly the best amateur score-player that
we have ever seen. Of that there can be no question.</p>

<p>So far as I can make out I played very little golf
in 1893. Probably I was amusing myself with
being ill, in some form or other, but in 1894, I
had golf and greatness thrust upon me by being
elected captain of the Royal Liverpool Golf Club.
The local people showed me no little kindness, and
made my year of office very pleasant. I stayed at the
ever hospitable house of Alec Sinclair, most cheery
of companions, just beside the links, and I see by the
record that they were kind enough to let me win the
first medal on the first day of the spring meeting and
again the first medal on the first day of the autumn
meeting. The following year I was not at the spring
meeting, but at the autumn meeting I won the first
medal on both days. The next year again I won the
second medal on both days of the autumn meeting&mdash;rather
a quaint record and one that I am proud of.</p>

<p>I am proud, because those Hoylake medals were
not very easy to win. The local talent, with Johnny
Ball and Hilton always on hand&mdash;Jack Graham was
not yet a force to reckon with&mdash;was very formidable.
But I remember that on one of these winning occasions
I had a portentous piece of luck. It was playing to
the then third hole. We drove from the present
second tee, but the green was about where some estimable
gentleman's dining-room now stands&mdash;far to
the left of the present second green. It was a ridge
and furrow green, so that though you could reach
the hole with an iron club for the second shot you were
grateful enough if you holed out in four. By some
providential chance my second, with the driving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
iron, found its way into the hole, saving two clear
shots. It is the biggest and best fluke I ever had on a
medal day, and I took good advantage of it.</p>

<p>By way of showing what an extraordinary condition
the handicapping at some of the Clubs had fallen into
at that date, I may note that Johnny Ball, Hilton and
I were all handicapped at Hoylake, for a short time about
this period, at <i>plus</i> eleven! You see what the effect
was&mdash;you see what kind of player a scratch player
would be, when there were such penalty handicaps as
this. As a matter of fact I believe the absurdity arose
from a tender feeling for the too acute sensibilities
of certain players who had been what was known as
"scratch" in the old days and liked to style themselves
so still, and yet could only be kept on the scratch
mark, in any reasonable handicap, by penalizing the
good players to such a terrific extent as this.</p>

<p>In that year, 1894, when I was captain of the club,
the amateur championship was played on the Hoylake
course, and I have a lively remembrance of it because
it was the first time that I came up against poor Freddy
Tait, as a grown golfer, and suffered at his hands and
from the peculiar characteristics of his game. Again
and again I had the better of him, in a tight and well-fought
match, and again and again he came up,
from somewhere right off the green, with a wonderful
approach, which he followed by a good putt and so
halved the hole. Going to the last hole we were all
even. His second was away to the left, far off the
green. He laid up one of his usual approaches and
put himself within holable distance. My own second
was a very good one, and I had a chance of a three.
I know even now that I went for it all too boldly,
rather tired by the recoveries of the gallant Freddy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
He holed his putt. I, with a much shorter one to
hole, missed: and so he won hole and match.</p>

<p>He was really but a lad then, though a strong and
sturdy one, but in the next round he met his master
in Mure Ferguson. That brought Mure into the final
with Johnny Ball against him, and very gallantly
Mure played. Johnny had some holes the better of
him to begin with, but he was not, even then, playing
quite like his old self, and he let Mure wear him down,
and only by a very daring and splendid shot at the
seventeenth hole did he take the lead and practically
settle the match, and the championship.</p>

<p>Freddy Tait was the very keenest golfer, as a boy,
that I ever saw. I had watched him at St. Andrews,
growing up from small boy's to young man's estate,
and acquiring the mastery of his clubs as he grew.
He was a favourite with everybody. At this time,
when he beat me at Hoylake, he was still in the hard-hitting
phase of his game, rejoicing, as a young man
will, in his strength, and delighting to let the ball
have it. And he had great strength. Later, as his
game developed, he grew to play more within himself
with more reserve force to call up when occasion required
it, than any other first-class player, and at
times he played very finely and very accurately
indeed. But at all times, even when he was not
playing accurately, he was very dangerous, just by
reason of this, his marvellous faculty for recovery,
which he exhibited even in this match against me at
Hoylake. You never had him beaten at any hole.
That not only made him in himself very formidable,
but it also made him very difficult to play against,
because you never felt any confidence that you had
him. I do not know whether it was this quality of
his game, or some other influence more psychic and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
personal, but for some reason Harold Hilton appeared
to find it almost impossible to produce his true game
when he was brought up against Freddy Tait. He
gives some account of it in his own reminiscences,
showing too that by steadfast work and stern endeavour
to get the better of that influence&mdash;really it was as if
Freddy put the evil eye on him&mdash;he was succeeding in
conquering it. He made a progressively better fight
in their later matches. For Johnny Ball, on the other
hand, Freddy had no terrors. I was surprised, looking
through poor Freddy's biography, written by Johnny
Low, to see how consistently Johnny Ball had the
better of Freddy&mdash;I think with only one exception
of any importance at all&mdash;in the many matches that
they played together. I had thought the balance
would have stood far more level, especially as Johnny
was not quite at his best when Freddy began to tackle
him. Their matches were well fought and close,
but Johnny won a very big majority.</p>

<h4>THE COMING OF THE THREE GREAT MEN</h4>


<p>I have said that a little white-haired boy used to
carry my clubs at Westward Ho! in my Oxford
days. Also that, a few years later, reappearing as an
assistant greenkeeper on the course, he was put against
me, representing the Northam village club against
the Royal North Devon, and gave me a beating.
The next year the Club organized a professional
tournament. Archie Simpson, at that time in the
best of his form and one of the most likely champions,
though he never did win the championship, came
down to take part in it, and at a certain point in the
competition word came in to the club-house that
Taylor (he was the little white-haired boy, and the
lad who beat me for the village club) was leading the
great Archie, and likely to beat him. Therefore there
sallied forth a gallery to see this great thing happen;
and thereby effectively prevented its happening, for
the gallery affected the untried nerves of the lad, he
fell away from grace, and Archie Simpson just got
home on him.</p>

<p>Soon after that, Canon, now Monsignor, Kennard,
carried him off to take charge of the green at Burnham
in Somersetshire, and a year or two later, at the open
championship at Prestwick (I think in the year that
Auchterlonie won) Taylor electrified everybody by
putting in a first round which was better than ever
had been heard of before. But he could not keep it
going and failed to make good.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1894 the open was at Sandwich. From first
to last there was one, and one only, most likely winner&mdash;J.
H. Taylor. His driving was of so marvellous a
correctness that it was said that the guide flags were
his only hazards, and his pitching was perfect. He
was but twenty-three, and I feared all the while lest
he should not be able to keep it up. Coming to the
last hole he had strokes to spare to win it. I think
a seven would have served him. I found myself
beside Philpot, so long at Mitcham, but an old
Northam man, and said, "He's bound to be right
now, unless he goes to pieces altogether." Philpot
answered with confidence, "He won't do that, if I
know anything of 'un." And he did not. He played
that last hole quite sufficiently well. The championship
was his.</p>

<p>It meant a great deal, that championship. It
meant a great deal not only to Taylor personally,
but also to all English professional golf. You see,
Taylor was really the first English professional.
Hitherto, when we wanted professionals, we had
always been importing them from the North. It
did not occur to the English caddie that he might
become a professional, that there were possibilities,
and money, in it. But all these possibilities the success
of Taylor revealed to the English. Moreover, Taylor
in himself was not only a very fine golfer; he was
also a very fine, in some respects a very remarkable,
man. He had a character. He was determined
to go straight, to give himself all chances. He was
teetotal. He had himself perfectly in hand in every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
way. He was a great example to the profession and
to all the English that should take it up, following
his example. It is not easy to over-rate what that
success of Taylor's meant for the professional golf
of England. It was an influence which re-acted upon
Scotland too.</p>

<p>The next year, at St. Andrews, Taylor won again, and
really there seemed no particular reason at that
time why he should not go on winning indefinitely.
He was distinctly more accurate and certain than any
of the older men, and there seemed no immediate
sign of any younger man coming up to dispute his
supremacy.</p>

<p>And then at Muirfield, the following year, I heard
(I was not there) to my surprise that one Harry Vardon,
a Jersey man, had tied with him. We had heard of
the Vardons by this time, but the common idea was
that Tom, the other brother, was the stronger man.
It was not Taylor's idea, however. He told me
afterwards that he had realized, even then, even
before the competition, what a terror this Harry Vardon
was. Perhaps it was the consciousness of this
that helped Harry Vardon to beat him in playing off
the tie; for beat him, to my great surprise, he did,
and so there we have the second of our great men already
arrived.</p>

<p>In spite of this defeat by the great Harry, whose
unique greatness even then we did not at all fully
appreciate, the big man in golf was still Taylor. He
was still at the very top of his game. And about the
same time we began to hear that there was a young
fellow working as a club-maker at the Army and Navy
Stores, who was capable of playing a very good
game of golf. He was said to be a cousin of Douglas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Rolland, the great driver, and, like him, to come from
Elie, in Fifeshire. His name was James Braid. Few
people knew much about him, but the few who had
seen him play had the greatest opinion of his game.
He was brought forward, on half-holidays when he
could get away from the Stores, to play exhibition
matches, and amongst these matches was one that he
played against Taylor at West Drayton; and he
played that great man to a level finish.</p>

<p>That was a result which caused a buzz of talk.
The young fellow at the Stores was evidently worth
watching, perhaps worth exploiting. Not very long
after this the newly formed club at Romford, in Essex,
found itself in want of a professional. James Braid
was engaged for the post.</p>

<p>I had a game with him shortly after he was appointed
to that job, and what impressed me about him more
than anything else was the enormous distance that he
could smite the ball with the cleek. I remember
that this ability to get huge distances with the iron
clubs was the quality that had most struck me when
first I became acquainted with the game of Rolland,
and I said to Braid, "It seems to me you can drive
just as far as Douglas Rolland can." He looked at
me a moment, as if in a kind of mild surprise that I
should make such a comment, and said, "Oh yes, sir,
I think I can do that."</p>

<p>It was an amusing answer: also it was an answer
which meant a good deal, coming from a man so absolutely
unable to swagger or to over-rate his own
power as James Braid. I realized that we had here
a great force in golf; but it was rather a long while
before he made that force fully felt. Nevertheless
it was there: he too had "arrived," though it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
not for a year or two that he was fated to begin the
writing of his name first on the championship list.
But he was there: the triumvirate was complete.</p>

<p>Never, as leaders at any game, were there three
men so closely matched with methods so widely
different. You may put that down in large measure,
if you please, to the physical, anatomical differences
of the three: there was Taylor, square, short, compact,
stubby; there was Braid, long, loose-jointed; and
there was Vardon, a happy medium between the two,
and really a very finely-shaped specimen of a powerful
human being. It is hardly to be questioned which
of the three had the most perfect and beautiful style.
Vardon hits up his body a little, away from the ball,
as he raises the club&mdash;that is a movement which we
should tell a learner was apt to unsettle the aim a little.
It did not upset Vardon's aim; but then Vardon was
rather past the learner stage. For the rest his style
was the perfection of power and ease. Taylor, with
the ball opposite the right toe and every stroke played
rather on the model generally approved for the half
iron shot, had a style as peculiar as his "cobby"
build, and specially adapted for it. Braid swung in
a loose-jointed way at the ball that did not suggest
the mastery and the accuracy which he achieved. I
have spoken of a kind of "divine fury" with which
he launched himself at the ball. Those were long
before the days of his studies in "Advanced Golf"
and so on. I doubt whether he played according to
any very conscious method. But the results well
justified the method, or the method-lessness. For
a while there was little to choose between these three
great ones.</p>

<p>But by degrees it became evident that there was a choice: that one really was distinctly better than the
other two. Certainly there was a while, just before he
had to go to a health resort, with a threatening of tuberculosis,
when Harry Vardon was in a class by himself.
For a while he was, I think, two strokes in the round
better than either Taylor or Braid, and, I believe, better
than any other man that we have seen. He was the
first professional I ever saw play in knickerbockers,
and with the flower at his button-hole he set a mode of
gaiety and smartness to the rest which younger men
were not slow to follow. There was a gay <i>insouciance</i>
about his whole manner of addressing himself to the
game which was very attractive. It was as different,
as their styles were different, from the imperturbability
of Braid or again from the tense and highly strung
temperament of Taylor. The three great men provided
a striking contrast in every particular. But
they had this in common, that they all took the game
earnestly and kept themselves very fit and well, in
order to do their best in it; therein marking a new
point of departure from the usual mode of the Scottish
professional of old days, who was a happy-go-lucky
fellow, not taking all the care of himself that he should
if he was to excel in such a strenuous game as golf.
And the example of these men was infectious, so that
we have now arrived at the date of the coming of the
great army of English professionals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h4>THE REVOLT OF THE AMAZONS</h4>


<p>Lord Moncrief (then Wellwood) writing in
the Badminton Book on Golf, had said that
ladies were relegated and restricted to a species
of "Jew's quarter" where they were graciously permitted
to play with a single club, the putter, those
little strokes which we all of us are fond of saying
are the most important in the game of golf, but which
we all feel to be the least interesting.</p>

<p>It was either in 1892 or 1893 that Lord Eldon
asked me to stay with him at his Gloucestershire
place, Stowell Park, on the Cotswolds, and there,
incidentally, I received quite a new impression as to
the possibilities of feminine golf. I had already
played on the long links at Prestwick in foursome
matches with the Misses Whigham&mdash;Johnny Laidlay
being the man on the other side, and taking one of the
sisters as his partner, while I took the other; but
they had not then come to their full golfing due. They
were rather in the phase which would now be known as
the "flapper stage." Still, they played remarkably
well. But the most remarkable thing, as we
thought then, was not that they should play the long
game so well, but that they should play it at all.
It was like Dr. Johnson's comment about the dancing
dogs. They played, and we as their partners played,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
with all consciousness that we were guilty things,
doing that which we ought not to do. It was an
enormity for ladies to play on the long links at all.</p>

<p>At Stowell Lord Eldon had a course of nine very
good and interesting holes in the park, and there
I found the Scott brothers, Osmond and Denys,
playing with their sister, Lady Margaret. I had
never at that time seen any lady capable of playing
at all the same kind of game that Lady Margaret
could and did play. You must remember that these
were the days of the solid gutta-percha balls, which
were far less easy to pick up clean off the ground and
raise, without putting a little slice on them, than the
modern rubber-cores. The ladies have especially been
helped by the more resilient balls which rise more
readily. But Lady Margaret Scott had a perfect
facility in picking the ball up with her brassey, off the
ordinary lie of the course, and sending it flying straight
to the mark without any slice on it. She had a very
long, an exaggeratedly long, swing back, but then the
weakness of the extra long swing back was not realized
at that time as it is now, and certainly she never seemed
to lose control of the club, although there must have
been some wasted labour about it.</p>

<p>I never had seen a lady able to play golf at all as
Lady Margaret played the game. She had all the
crisp and well-cut approach strokes at her command.
It was some years after this that the ladies' championship
was started. Meanwhile ladies, greatly daring,
had begun to play on the long links. As a rule they
would have been both better and happier on their
own short putting greens; but there were exceptions
who were quite able, by their skill, to appreciate the
longer courses and to play them as well as the men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
As soon as ever the ladies' championship was instituted,
Lady Margaret Scott (now Hamilton Russell) justified
all the opinions I had formed of her game by winning
that championship three times in annual succession.
And I think that the only reason why she did not go
on winning it was that she did not go on playing for
it. Surely she had done enough for glory.</p>

<p>It is very unprofitable work trying to estimate the
relative golfing merits of different generations, but I am
disposed to think that our best ladies of to-day (whom
shall we name? I think Miss Ravenscroft and Miss
Leitch) are not greatly better, if at all, than Lady
Margaret at her best. We have to take the
difference in balls into consideration for one thing.
It is certain that the change to the livelier ball has
helped the best of the ladies more than the best of
the men. But I get a certain line of comparison in this
way: some of the finest of the lady golfers, when
ladies first began to invade the long links, were the
Misses Orr. They used to play at North Berwick.
But they did not, in the daring fashion of the ladies
to-day, claim to play at reasonable hours. They
started very early and were finishing their round when
lazy men were finishing their breakfast. They were
just about representative of the best feminine golf
of the time, and on the only occasion in which they
took part in the Ladies' Championship one sister
beat another in the final. I played one of them at
Nairn, giving, as far as I remember, a half, and that
seemed to bring us very nearly together. In these
latter days, since the ladies have claimed, and as I
think, quite rightly claimed, practically an equal
right to our long links, we have had several matches
at odds of a half, and again they have worked out very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
level. There was that much-talked-of match between
Miss Cecil Leitch and Harold Hilton. The lady won
it. I do not think that either played up to his or her
true game, unless it was perhaps Miss Leitch in the
final round. But the match was a close one, showing
that the odds were adequate for bringing the sexes
to something like a golfing equality. Then again,
giving the same odds of a half, we played a team of
men against a team of ladies at Stoke Poges. The
one side was just about as representative as the other.
Our masculine side won. To this day I do not
know how we won: I do not understand how it is
that the best of the men (speaking of amateurs) is
able to give the best of the ladies anything like a half,
but it does appear that these are very approximately
the right odds, and it also appears that these have
been just about the odds ever since the ladies began
to play the long game. The inference is that the
quality of the game of the best of them has not greatly
altered. I know that when I played Miss Violet Hezlet
in that Stoke Poges match, I found myself hardly at
all in front of her off the tee, when we both hit good
shots, going against the wind. Down the wind it was
quite another story: I could outdrive her usefully
with the wind behind. And here I think it possible
to give ladies a hint by which they might profit:
if they would but tee their ball high, going down the
wind, they would find it far more easy to give it that
hoist into the air which is essential for its getting
advantage of the favour of the breeze. They seem to
have a lofty-minded idea that there is something not
quite right about putting the ball on a high tee&mdash;that
it is rather on a par with potting the white at billiards.
It is splendid of them to have such fine and noble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
ideals, but it would be to their practical advantage
to forget them now and then.</p>

<p>And I am quite sure that the ladies, as a rule, do not
take the pains they should about their putting and
the short game generally. There is but one of them,
Miss Grant Suttie, so far as I have seen, who really
studies her putts as a good man player studies them,
and that is because she has played so much with men
at North Berwick and has adopted their methods.
She has her advantage therein, for she is the most
certain on the green of all the ladies. It is a wonder,
seeing that it is a part of the game which demands
delicacy of touch and no strength of muscle, that ladies
do not putt far better than men. As a general rule
they putt far worse.</p>

<p>Naturally, when this incursion of the ladies arrived
on the links of the men, it intensified the trouble of
those problems of the congestion of the green which
were already beginning to be acute. Naturally, too,
men dealt with the incursion according to their powers
and according to their gallantry. No doubt it was felt
that it was a hard and discourteous thing to deny
the ladies equal rights, even over the private courses.
Obviously, on the public courses they had the equal
right, and they were not shy of claiming it. On the
private courses we used to hear at first, "It's absurd,
these ladies not sticking to their own course: they
can't drive far enough to be able to appreciate the
long course," and so on. But then it very soon became
evident that they could drive further and play better
than a large number of the male members of the Club,
which rather knocked the bottom out of that argument.
As a rule some compromise was effected, the ladies
being restricted to certain hours&mdash;after all, the men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
were generally workers, so that they had the more
claim to have the course at their disposal in their
hours of leisure. A very good form of compromise is
that which is in vogue at Biarritz, and it may be
commended to the notice of other Clubs. There is one
afternoon in the week set apart for all and sundry
ladies, but besides this there is a permission for ladies
whose handicap is four or under to play at any time
and on equal terms with the men. This seems to meet
the case admirably, for it keeps off the links the
inefficient lady players who would be apt to block
the green and whose right place is their own short
course, while it freely admits those who are capable
of appreciating the blessings of the long course and
are quite as good golfers as the average of the men
whom they will meet there. As time goes on it appears
as if we shall be fortunate if the ladies do not take
exclusive possession of the links, and only allow us
men upon them at the hours which are the least
convenient.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h4>THE MAKING OF INLAND COURSES</h4>


<p>The first architect of the inland courses, when
golfers began to learn that inland courses
might, in some large measure, give them the game
that they wanted, was Tom Dunn. He went about
the country laying the courses out, and as he was a
very courteous Nature's gentleman, and always liked
to say the pleasant thing, he gave praise to each
course, as he contrived it, so liberally that some wag
invented the conundrum. "Mention any inland course
of which Tom Dunn has not said that it is the best
of its kind ever seen."</p>

<p>His idea&mdash;and really he had but one&mdash;was to throw
up a barrier, with a ditch, called for euphony's sake
a "bunker," on the near side of it, right across the
course, to be carried from the tee, another of the
same kind to be carried with the second shot, and
similarly a third, if it was a three shot hole, for the
third shot. It was a simple plan, nor is Tom Dunn
to be censured because he could not evolve something
more like a colourable imitation of the natural hazard.
A man is not to be criticized because he is not in
advance of his time.</p>

<p>Moreover, these barriers had at least the merit that
they were uncompromising. You had to be over
them, or else you found perdition, and if you only
hacked the ball out a little way beyond the first barrier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
with your first shot you could not carry the second
barrier with your third. You were like a hurdle
racer who has got out of his stride.</p>

<p>The course, constructed on these lines, on which I
used to play most, from London, was Prince's at
Mitcham&mdash;the most convenient of access of all, before
the days of motors. I used to have great matches here
with Jack White, before Sunningdale was made and
he went there in charge.</p>

<p>Subsequently the mantle of Tom Dunn, as course
constructor in chief, fell on the shoulders of Willy
Park, and his ideas were more varied. He was also
a good deal more thorough, more elaborate and more
expensive in his dealings with the inland courses.
He was the first to advocate the wholesale ploughing
up of the soil of the course, and the re-sowing. He
architected Broadstone, Sunningdale and a host more,
and when he had finished with the Sunningdale
green he had certainly produced the best thing in the
way of an inland course that up to that time had
been created. He did his work well, but it was not
entirely or even mainly due to him that Sunningdale
was so good. The soil was more light and sandy,
more like the real seaside links, than that of any other
inland course.</p>

<p>They had done wonderful things at New Zealand,
where Mr. Lock-King, with Mure Ferguson aiding and
abetting, had fastened mighty engines to pine trees
and dragged them up by the roots, fashioning a golf
course out of a pine forest.</p>

<p>That was pioneer's work in a double sense, for it
not only engineered this particular course where the
trees had covered all the land, but it also showed to
other people how possible it was to make a course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
out of forest in other places. It is not only possible,
but it is also a good deal less laborious, to grub up the
forest trees than it is to get rid of a very dense growth
of smaller undergrowth, such as there was to deal
with at Le Touquet, in France, for instance. Then the
soil in all this pine forest country, such as we see about
Woking and Byfleet, is very light and sandy, as the
inland soils go, so that it was fine natural material
for golf when once the trees had gone. The latest
construction of the kind is at St. George's Hill, near
Weybridge, where the trees had been much better
cared for for generations and in consequence were far
larger and more difficult of up-rooting than at New
Zealand. There they had to blast the boles of the
trees with dynamite before they could get them out
of the ground. But of course the bigger timber was
of greater value and helped to pay the labour bill.</p>

<p>These forest courses have done another thing for
us, they have taught us the value of a tree as a golfing
hazard. Our forefathers would have scoffed at the
idea of a tree on a golf links, although there was for
many a long year opportunity for the golfer to find
trouble in the trees which came out threatening the
course at a certain point at North Berwick. But
then they did not have their actual roots in the soil
of the links itself. They were outside it, over the
boundary wall. But as for the opportunities which
the tree hazard gives for those subtleties of slicing and
pulling round, or of cutting the ball up with a very
vertical rise, let those who have seen Harry Vardon
on a course of this tree-beset kind bear witness. And
the tree has at least this virtue: that it is permanent.
It does not get trodden down and hacked out of existence
by a niblick as the faint-hearted whin does.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>At Woking the natural trouble on the ground was
heather rather than trees, and a fine course they have
made of it. But of all, that at Sunningdale has always
seemed to me just about the best of the inland ones&mdash;certainly
the best of the earlier made ones. Then I
was at Walton Heath, as a guest of Mr. Cosmo Bonsor's
kindly hospitality, when that great inland green was
opened. Harry Colt had by that time gone to Sunningdale,
and was making improvements on the original
plan of Willy Park, but Walton Heath was a monument
to the skill of that other of our amateur course
constructors, Herbert Fowler. He made a very good
thing of it, as the wonderful success of that Club has
testified since. But it soon passed out of the hands
of Mr. Bonsor, and for how much the energy of Sir
George Riddell, who acquired the chief interest in it,
counted in its popularity it would be very hard to say.
Assuredly it counted for a great deal. Then they
had James Braid, importing him from Romford, and
his attractive personality and great fame helped the
Club. Another like him, our old friend Taylor, was
by this time established at Mid-Surrey, and the Club
there was a power, by reason of the goodness of its
green, its numbers and the strong players belonging
to it.</p>

<p>It would be a very dull and futile business to go into
all the development of the inland golf which went on
during these years. Enough has been said. But you
could not draw anything like a full picture of the golf
of the last fifty years without noticing this development.
The inland Clubs, and especially those about
London, have become a force. As their members
go forth to play from the big City which is the common
centre they are the better able to make their opinion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
felt; and their word has become of importance in
modern golf. It is possible that it is destined to have
a larger importance yet. But I have no business with
prophecy.</p>

<p>And also there are big inland Clubs, which have
already brought weight to bear on golfing counsels,
in the Midlands. They have associated themselves
into a Union, as have several other clusters, and all
these help in the forming and expression of opinion.
But, apart from all this, the great reason why they
attract members and why they are able to carry weight
at all is that their courses are so good. The course
constructor has been learning, and so has the greenkeeper.
I had a delightful letter from Peter Lees,
the famous greenkeeper to the Mid-Surrey Club.
He writes: "When I find the worms too numerous,
I reduce them." The worm used to be the great
trouble and despair of the guardian of the inland putting
green in the old days, but here we have Lees writing
of dealing with them as it were by the very nod of
Jove. When he finds them too numerous, he "reduces
them." The mode of reduction is so well known and
so easy that he does not think it worth while to waste
a word of explanation on it. We have the nice story
of a certain greenkeeper of the olden school being
asked, "What kind of grass is this?" the inquirer
referring to a sample that he had just picked up from
the course. "Oh," came the puzzled reply, "there's
only one sort of grass&mdash;green grass." That is a reply
that is almost typical of the "green-ness" of the greenkeeper
in the earliest days of the management&mdash;if that
is the right word for it&mdash;of the inland greens, but the
modern keeper has to "discourse in learned phrases"
of such varieties as fescues and poas, and hardly thinks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
himself entitled to full respect unless he can fire you
off all the Latin names of the varieties of grasses that
occur on our inland greens and courses. The keeping
has really become quite a science.</p>

<p>And at their best, that is when the weather is
treating them kindly, there is not that vast difference
in quality between the best of our inland greens and
the seaside greens which our forefathers have led us
to suppose. The big merit of the seaside links, which
the inland can never hope to match, is that it is such
a good all-weather course. With its porous soil it
does not become so water-logged in the wet years,
nor does it become so dessicated in the dry. It
is a more perpetual joy. But the days are long past
when men could say that the seaside links were the
only ones worth playing on, or that the seaside Clubs
alone were worthy of attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<h4>VARIOUS CHAMPIONSHIPS AND THE
WANDERING SOCIETIES</h4>


<p>Whether on account of ill-health, or for what
reasons, I do not know, I was not a very sedulous
attendant at the championships in the later
nineties. The consequence was that I missed seeing
one or two very notable finishes. I was not at St.
Andrews, for instance, that year when Leslie Balfour-Melville
won, having carried each of his last three
matches to the nineteenth hole, and each of his three
opponents being obliging enough to plop his ball into
the burn at that very crucial point of the business.
What made it the more notable is that the last of these
burn-ploppers was no other than Johnny Ball himself.
Neither was I at Muirfield when Dr. Allan won,
bicycling over each day, from a considerable distance,
to the course, and playing without a nail in his boot&mdash;surely
the most casual and unconcerned of champions.
And I missed, too, that great finish between Johnny
Ball and Freddy Tait, at Prestwick, when they were all
even at the end of thirty-six holes, after playing the ball
out of water and doing all kinds of conjuring tricks
at the thirty-fifth hole: and then Johnny settled the
affair by getting a scarcely human three at the thirty-seventh.
But I was at Sandwich a year or two before
when Freddy Tait did win the championship, beating
Harold Hilton in the final. I was even one of his
victims on that occasion. He was playing well, but
he gave me a chance or two going out and I was two
up at the turn. Then, at the tenth hole I had a bit
of bad luck: I lay, off the tee shot, in the middle of
the course, right in a deep divot-cut left by a never
identified but never to be sufficiently execrated sinner.
So Freddy won that hole, and he out-played me soundly
on the long holes coming in. I remember that I
had a great fight the day before with that very gallant
golfer, who never did himself full justice in the
big fights, Arnold Blyth. We halved the round and I
only beat him at the twenty-second hole.</p>

<p>I was at St. Andrews, too, in 1901 and saw the
finish between Harold Hilton and Johnny Low, one
of the best that ever has been played. Here, too, I
was the victim of the ultimate winner; and I do not
know that I had any need to be beaten by him, for
though Hilton won this championship, he has said
himself in his memoirs that he was not playing as he
should, at the time. I believe the truth to have been,
as he himself suggests, that we were all a little frightened
of him. I remember we started in pouring rain,
and he won the first three holes off me. Then the
weather improved and so did I, so that I wore off these
three holes and got one up with five to play. At this
fatal point I pulled my tee shot into one of those
pernicious little bunkers on the Elysian Fields called
the Beardies, and the final holes Hilton played more
strongly than I did and won by two and one to play.
It is a curious thing that the only other time of my
meeting him in the amateur championship, which was
at Hoylake in the year that Johnny Ball won from
Aylmer in the final, the match was almost a replica<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
of this former one. Again he won the first three holes,
again I wore him down and got one up with five to
play, and again I chucked away the advantage, and
it looked almost sure that he would again win by two
and one. But I holed a good putt at the seventeenth
to save that hole. He gave me no chance of winning
the last, and so again he beat me. These are the only
two meetings we have had in the championship, and
neither, from my point of view, is very glorious in
the telling.</p>

<p>The year 1900 was a very unhappy one in the history
of golf. In that year a Boer bullet ended the life of
one of the most gay and gallant-hearted fellows that
ever took up a club, Freddy Tait, and incidentally
took a good deal of the interest out of the golf of our
generation. That year, and also the next, Johnny
Ball was out at the war, and did not take part in the
championship; and I think that these are actually
the only two occasions since the institution of the
amateur championship that he has not had a hand
in it. He is very capable of taking a master hand
still.</p>

<p>I have said little of the open championship during
these years, for the reason that it has never had anything
like the same attraction for me, either to play
in or as a spectacle, as the amateur, in which golfers
are brought together in matches, and there is the clash of
temperaments, the man to man contest, the one bringing
out (or driving in, as the case may be) all that is
best in the other. I cannot see that any scoring
competition ever competes, in the human and psychological
interest, with such duels as these.</p>

<p>But the story of the open championship for very
many a year now&mdash;that is to say, from 1899 right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
away to 1913&mdash;is the story of the repeated triumphs of
three men, Taylor, Vardon, Braid, one or other accounting
for the championship in no less than fifteen of
these years, and for the rest allowing a win each to
Harold Hilton, to Herd, to White, to Massy and to
Ray&mdash;a wonderful record, but one which shows a
certain monotony. Of the championship of 1902,
both amateur and open, the story has its peculiar
interest, because this was the year of the introduction
of the indiarubber-cored&mdash;then called Haskell&mdash;balls,
about which many fables are to be narrated. And I
am going to cut the story of these championships rather
short, at this point, because I seem to have so much
to say both about the first Haskell ball championship
and also about the amateur championships of 1903 and
1904, that either one of them cries aloud for the dignity
of a chapter all to itself.</p>

<p>These, or just about these, were the years of the
formation of the wandering teams, notably of the
Oxford and Cambridge Golfing Society, formed on
the model of the wandering cricket clubs, such as the
I. Zingari and the Free Foresters. These admirable
institutions had no club-house, no green, only a
corporate existence, and they said to the various
Clubs, "Now, you give us the free run of your course
and a free luncheon and other entertainment, and if
you do this we'll be so good as to come down and
play a team match against your members and probably
give them a jolly good beating." That was the kind
of proposal which they made to the Clubs, and the
pleasant sign of the times and of good sportsmanship
and feeling is that the Clubs were so very ready to
entertain it&mdash;both the proposals and the societies.
There were the Bar Golfing Society, the Solicitors',<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the Army&mdash;every self-respecting profession had to
have its Golfing Society. The Oxford and Cambridge,
of which I had the honour to be first president, being
succeeded in that honourable post by Mr. Arthur
Balfour, went on pilgrimage actually as far as the
United States; and very well they did there, under
the leadership of Johnny Low and with Johnny
Bramston, the Hunter brothers and other fine golfers
assisting. But as for the most part of these golfing
enterprises of the wanderers, who, generally speaking,
had their headquarters in the great metropolis, it is
evident that they had to find their happy hunting
grounds somewhere round about London, within reasonable
reach, and that was only possible by virtue of the
rise of all those inland greens within a short distance
of the big town, which has had the further effect of
drawing down into what we call the "Southern Section"
the very big majority of the best professional
players. This geographical golfing phrase of "Southern
Section" is one that has arisen only out of the
conditions created by that great tournament for the
professionals promoted by the <i>News of the World</i> newspaper;
and that competition itself is a witness to the
growing recognition by the English world of the importance
of golf and of its financial meaning. Golf
was of use in the way of big advertisement. Also,
the largest proprietors of the <i>News of the World</i> were,
and are, very good golfers and sportsmen, and doubtless
appreciate all the good sport that this tournament
provides. But, at the same time, we should, I think,
wrong their commercial instincts if we did not realize
that they see good advertisement in it besides. Men's
motives are mixed. How well that team of Oxford
and Cambridge graduates that went to America per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>formed,
we hardly realized at the time. We had a
tendency to under-rate the American ability for golf,
and the very fact that these pilgrims did so well
inclined us all the more to make light of the American
prowess. We are now, in course of the story, within
sight of the year when Mr. Walter Travis, coming over
here, was to give us a very different idea of the American
capacity. We then began, perhaps, to go to the other
extreme and to over-rate what they could do. They
seemed to have "established a funk," to put it in
homely phrase, which only Harold Hilton, going to
America as our amateur champion and coming back
with all the glory of the American amateur championship
about him too, could altogether dissipate. But
before that happened a lot of water had to run under
the bridges.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE COMIC COMING OF THE HASKELL
BALL</h4>


<p>In 1891 my brother-in-law, returning from a visit to
America, came down to stay and to play golf
with me at Ashdown Forest, and brought with him a
dozen or two of a new kind of ball which, he said, had
lately been invented in the United States and was
the best ball in the world. The balls were called, as
he told me, Haskells. We went out to play with them.
He, as it happened, played very badly, and in a very
short time he was perfectly ready to go into any
court of law and take his oath that they were the
worst balls in the world. I had formed my own
opinion of them, much more in accord with the verdict
with which he had first introduced them to me than
with that condemnatory one which he passed on them
after two days of being off his game; but I refrained
from expressing my opinion too emphatically, with
the result that when he went away he said that, as for
the remnant of the balls, he was not going to be
bothered "to take the beastly things away," so that I
found myself the possessor of a couple of dozen or so
of excellent Haskell balls&mdash;being, as he had said, in
the first instance, the best balls in the world&mdash;at a
time when no one else in Great Britain had such a ball
at all!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>It is quite true that some months previously, at
North Berwick, I had been given to try, by a professional
who had just returned from the States, a ball
which I now recognized to be the same, in some of its
essentials, as these Haskells which my brother-in-law
brought over. It was the same, except for one external
but extremely important essential&mdash;its nicks were
ridiculously too light and slight, not nearly enough
indented. So I tried that ball and found it wanting&mdash;it
would not fly at all. But what I did not realize
at the time was the reason why it did not fly; or,
if I did realize, as one could not fail to do, that the nicks
were not emphatic enough, I had not a suspicion of
the merit of its interior qualities. I had not appreciated
that it was an amazingly good ball if only this
slight matter of its exterior marking had been attended
to. I had taken no more thought or notice of it.</p>

<p>Armed with these new weapons I prepared to go out
to Biarritz, where the annual foursome match against
Pau was just impending. My partner was to be
Evy Martin Smith, and as soon as I arrived I told
him that we must use these new balls for the match.
He strongly objected, being a firm Conservative,
tried the balls, with every intention of disliking them,
and disliked them accordingly. The fact is that I
was, at this moment, just the last man in the world
to appear on any scene as an advocate of a new ball.
Only a year or two before I had taken an unfortunate
interest in a patent substance called "Maponite,"
of which, in addition to a thousand and one other
things for which gutta-percha and indiarubber are
used, golf balls were to be made. And wherein
exactly was the weak point about the stuff as a material
for golf balls I never knew, for the trial balls that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
made for us were excellent&mdash;I remember that I won
an open tournament at Brancaster with them&mdash;but
as soon as ever they began to turn them out in numbers
they were useful for one end only&mdash;for the good of
the club-makers&mdash;for they were hard stony things
which broke up the wooden clubs as if one had used
the clubs as stone hammers.</p>

<p>So I was not a good apostle of a new ball&mdash;rather
discredited in fact&mdash;but I did induce Evy Smith to
play with the ball finally, under deep protest, and we
justified its use by winning. Meanwhile the balls
were beginning to filter from America into England.
It was difficult indeed to get people to appreciate their
merits: the balls were not numerous, and were still
hard to obtain. At Johnny Low's request I sent him
one for trial. He was writing at that time in the
<i>Athletic News</i>. He wrote a most amusing article
about the ball&mdash;said that he had tried a stroke or two
with it in his room, and had found it so resilient that it
went bounding about the room like a fives ball in a
squash court and finally disappeared up the chimney
and was never seen again.</p>

<p>In fine, he gave the ball his banning, "not because
it was an expensive ball"&mdash;it is to be remembered
that it was rather a shock to be asked to pay two and
sixpence for a golf ball, whereas before we had paid
a shilling as the normal price&mdash;"but because it was a
bad ball," meaning a ball "singularly ill-adapted
for the purpose" of golf. So difficult is it for even a
clever man and wise in the royal and ancient wisdom,
as Johnny Low undoubtedly is, to keep an unprejudiced
judgment about any new thing.</p>

<p>Expensive as the ball was in the beginning, it was
soon found that it was far more economical than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
solid "gutty"; both because it lasted in playable
condition far longer and also because it did not knock
about the wooden club to anything like the same
extent. But within a very short while there came
such a demand for those balls, so greatly in excess
of the supply, that there was a time when as much as a
guinea apiece was paid for them, and numbers changed
hands at ten shillings. That was round and about
the time of the championships, both open and amateur
being held that year at Hoylake, and both these championships
were won with the Haskell balls.</p>

<p>I am calling these balls Haskells, because that is the
name by which they were known and spoken of, after
their American inventor, at this time. The reluctance
of players to use them, and the gradual overcoming
of that reluctance, had many comic incidents
associated with it.</p>

<p>The amateur championship that year was full of
wonders. It was won by Charles Hutchings, he being
then a grandfather and fifty-two years of age. He
knocked me out, among other better men, beating me
at the last hole. And then he beat that brilliant and
greatly to be regretted young golfer, Johnny Bramston.
In the final he had to play Fry, and established a very
big lead on him in the first round. He had about six
holes in hand with only nine to play, and then Fry
began to do conjuring tricks, holing putts from the
edge of the green, and so on. In the event Charles
Hutchings just won by a single hole after one of the
most remarkable final matches in the whole story of
that championship. And it is to be noted that these
two finalists, who proved themselves better able than
most others to adapt themselves to the new touch
of these livelier balls&mdash;for nearly all the competitors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
used the Haskells&mdash;were extremely good billiard
players. Fry had won the amateur championship
of billiards more than once, and Hutchings was quite
capable of such atrocities as a three-figure break. I
think the sensitive fingers of these billiard players
helped them to get the touch of these livelier balls
which were so "kittle" for the approach and putting.</p>

<p>After the amateur came the open, in which I did
not take a hand, but I heard a great deal of the preliminary
discussions about it. Of course, if the amateurs
were difficult to convince about the merits of
the new balls, the professionals, who had their vested
interest in the old, and did not know how these were
to be affected by the coming of the new, were harder
still to convince. However, the balls were too good
to be denied. Andrew Kirkaldy, a shrewd man, and
one, besides, who had no interest in the sale of balls,
solid or rubber cored, was one of the first and most
enthusiastic converts. "The puggy," he declared,
"is a great ba'." He called it "puggy," which is
Scottish for monkey, because it jumped about so.
"Ye canna' tak' eighty strokes to the roun' wi' a
puggy&mdash;the puggy will na' gae roun' in eighty strokes."
However, on the morrow of making that brave statement,
he contrived, even with the "puggy," to take
several strokes more than eighty to go round the
Hoylake course for the championship. Alec Herd
was one of the most uncompromising opponents of
the new ball until the very day of the championship.
He had declared that he hoped everybody else would
play with the Haskell, but that for his own part he
meant to stick to his old friend. And then, on the
day of the play, behold Herd, who had said these
things, teeing up a Haskell himself on the first tee,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and continuing play with it until he had won the
championship! It was a bit of luck for him, hitting
on the truth about the merits of the ball just at the
right moment. I do not think he would ever have
won the championship save for the Haskell ball. At
the same time it is only fair to him to say this, that he
was&mdash;at least I think so&mdash;quite unlucky not to win
the championship two years previously. It was the
year that Taylor won at St. Andrews, and at that
date, and for some little while before the championship,
Herd had certainly been playing the best golf of anybody.
Then the weather changed, just on the eve
of the championship. There came abundance of
rain, which put the greens into just the condition that
Taylor liked. He won that championship, and Herd,
I think, was a little unfortunate not to win. But
fortune restored the balance of her favours by giving
him this win at Hoylake with the new ball long after
we had ceased to think him a likely champion. Thus
once again, "justice has been done." Therewith the
Haskell ball made its reputation and came to stay.
There was a talk of ruling it out, by the Rules of
Golf Committee, but Hall Blyth, then chairman,
agreed with me and others that it had won its way
too far into popularity to be made illegal, and the idea
of legislating it out was dropped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h4>AN HISTORIC MATCH AND AN HISTORIC
TYPE
</h4>

<p>Willy Park, always a man of some practical
ingenuity, as well as a magnificent golfer,
had lately invented and patented a peculiar type of
putter. He had also invented, by way of an advertisement
of this crooked-necked club of his, the dictum
that "the man who can putt is a match for anybody."</p>

<p>Now Park, besides his other fine qualities, was a
very gallant golfer. It had been his way for some
years, as soon as some man&mdash;be it Douglas Rolland,
or any other&mdash;had come to the top of the golfing
tree, so that everybody was talking about him and
saying what a fine fellow he was, to challenge this fine
top bird of the roost, and back his challenge with a
&pound;50 or &pound;100 stake. There may have been a tinge of
advertisement about it, for Park was a good man of
business and the first of the professionals to realize
what money there was in establishing golf shops, but
chiefly, I think, he played these matches for the pure
sport of the thing.</p>

<p>So now, Harry Vardon, being beyond dispute, at
the tree top, Park must issue a challenge to play him
for a money stake, a home and home match, two rounds
at North Berwick and two at Ganton. Now you have
to realize that in those days Harry Vardon was so
great a man, there was so much keenness to see him
play, that when he went out the gallery followed
him, they watched his every stroke, and they paid
no more attention than if he had no existence at all
to the poor wretch who chanced to be partnered with
him. They would trample on this unfortunate creature's
ball without the slightest remorse: he was
rather lucky if he were not thrown down and trampled
to death himself by the throng.</p>

<p>Willy Park was a shrewd Scot. He was not going
to have any of this nonsense when "the man who
could putt" set out to prove, for money, that he was
a match for anyone, even for Harry Vardon at his
best. The match opened, therefore, at its very second
shot, on the note of comedy. Park had gone a little
further off the tee than Harry Vardon, toward the
bunker guarding Point Garry Hill. That meant
that Harry Vardon had to play first, and after his
play of the second shot the gallery made a start to
dash in, in their accustomed manner, quite regardless
of the other partner to the match. Park proceeded
to teach them their lesson at the outset. He did not
hurry, like a guilty thing, to play his shot, as most
of the others who played with Vardon used to do:
instead, he left his ball altogether, with "Fiery,"
his faithful caddie, standing guard over it. The
people crowded forward as far as Fiery, but they were
not at all likely to go beyond him, most faithful
henchman, and rather truculent watch-dog, with
round Scotch bonnet and streamers floating behind,
the clubs loose held, out of the bag, beneath his arm&mdash;I
rather think he would have called it his "oxter"&mdash;because
he had for years carried clubs before bags
came into use, and the fine smoothness and polish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of the club handles was apt to be spoilt by dragging
them in and out of the bag. I never heard nor cared
what other name he had than Fiery, of which the
propriety was written in flaming colours on his face.
So he stood, facing and keeping back the crowd from
the ball&mdash;a subject not unworthy of an historical picture
and by no means to be disregarded as a point
in the golfing story of the last fifty years, because he
was a type, and nearly the last, of the old Scottish
caddies, and because this match was among the
last of those of the old style. Park's school was really
a generation behind that to which belonged the modern
triumvirate.</p>

<p>So Park walked on, having left his ball; he walked
on to the foot of Point Garry Hill; then he ascended
it, with great leisure, quite regardless that the people
raged together, and he looked at the flag, which he
did not in the least desire to see. All he did desire
was to teach the gallery their lesson, that he, Park,
meant to count for something in this match, that
Harry Vardon was not the only player; and when he
had thus taught the lesson, which it were better that
the people should learn first than last, he came back
leisurely to his ball again and played it.</p>

<p>They took their lesson well&mdash;a Scottish crowd is
not slow at the up-take and has its sense of humour.
Moreover, Park was their man, being a Scot. They
liked to see him taking himself seriously, and they did
not crowd on him inconveniently again.</p>

<p>And it was a most amusing match to watch, though
just a little pathetic too. Willy Park was most emphatically
"the man who could putt." He told me that he
had been practising putting for that match to the tune
of from six to eight hours a day. It sounds terribly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
dull work; but certainly Park was rewarded for it,
for I never saw such putting, day in and day out, as
he was doing about the time of that match. And
in the match he putted extraordinarily. I speak
only of the first portion, at North Berwick. I did
not see the latter end of it at Ganton; but I think
the result, if there ever could be, from the start, a moment's
doubt about it, was virtually all settled on the
first thirty-six holes. Park putted extraordinarily, but
he still had to prove his dictum that the man who could
putt was a match for anybody. Vardon as surely
could not putt; but then he played all the rest of
the game to a beautiful perfection, whereas poor Park
could not drive. He developed, at its worst, that
tendency to hook his drives which has always been
a danger to him. He arrived on the greens one stroke, or
even two, behind Vardon. But then he put the putt in,
whereas Vardon often neglected the simple precaution
of laying it dead. So it went on, Park saving himself
again and again by this marvellous putting, and at
last, after he had holed one of fifteen yards right
across the green, a crusty old Scot in the gallery was
heard grumbling to himself in his beard: "The on'y
raisonable putt I've seen the day." What he had come
out expecting, an all-knowing Providence alone can
say.</p>

<p>But the strain of those repeated saves of holes
apparently lost was too severe to last. Vardon put a
useful balance of holes to his credit even at North
Berwick. The final half of the match was to be played
on his own course of Ganton. There was only one possible
conclusion to it. At the end of the North Berwick
contest I suggested to Park that he would have to
re-edit his dictum so that it should run "the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
who can putt is a match for anybody&mdash;except Harry
Vardon," and he confessed, with a melancholy grin,
that he believed he would have to accept that emendation.</p>

<p>With the disappearance of the old Scottish caddie,
of whom Fiery might very well stand for the prototype,
there passed much of the old order of golf, making
way for the new. These old caddies themselves counted
for very much more in the play of the game than
our modern club-carriers, who are usually beasts of
burden (and little beasts at that, just passed out of
their Board School standards) and nothing more.
They know the names of the clubs, so as to give you
what you ask for, and that is about as much as is
expected of them. Sometimes they take a keen interest,
and identify themselves with their master's
interests; but such fidelity and keenness are rather
exceptional. The ancient caddie was a grown man:
he was not, perhaps, an ensample of all the virtues,
and if he turned up on a Monday morning without a
certain redness of the nose and possibly a blackness
of the eye, indicating a rather stormy Saturday night,
of which the intervening day of rest had not wholly
removed the damages, you might admire and be
thankful.</p>

<p>But his zeal for your matches was unfailing. He
made it a point of honour to do all that the law allowed
him, and all that it did not allow him, so long as he
was not found out, to aid and abet your inefficiency.
He expected that you should consult him about the
club that you should take, about the line on which
you should play and about the gradients of a putt.
He was a profound student of human nature, discovered
the weaknesses of your opponent and urged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
you by counsel and example to take advantage of them.
In my early days at St. Andrews, when I was playing
a match with David Lamb, I was surprised, and more
than a little shocked, by the counsel that one of these
sapient caddies gave me: "Let us walk oot pretty
smartly after the ba', sir. Mr. Lamb canna' bear
to be hurried." That was the proposal&mdash;that just
because Mr. Lamb had a dislike to playing in a hurry,
we should hasten on after the ball so as to induce him,
by the power of suggestion, to hurry also, and so put
him off his game. Needless to say, as soon as my innocence
had succeeded in comprehending the inward
meaning of the counsel, I repudiated it with scorn
and rebuked the caddie bitterly for suggesting it; and,
equally needless to say, he thought me both a thankless
person and a very particular species of Sassenach
fool for so rejecting it. I have often thought that had
Bret Harte known the old Scottish caddie he would
not have needed to go to the Orient and to the Yellow
Race for the type of mind that he has sketched in
his <i>Heathen Chinee</i>. Nevertheless there was very
much that was attractive and likeable in these henchmen
of a fervid loyalty and few moral attributes
besides, and their extermination, with that of other
strange <i>fer&aelig; natur&aelig;</i>, is to be regretted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE INTERNATIONAL MATCH</h4>


<p>Certainly the Royal Liverpool Club has deserved
well of the golfing community. It started
the amateur championship, and in 1891 or 1892 the idea
occurred to some enterprising genius at Hoylake
of the International Match. What though interest
rather waned in it, and it has been abandoned now,
during the years that it was played it was an interest to
many, both of those who played in it and of those who
merely looked on. They called me into their counsels
and we roughed out some such scheme as was ultimately
adopted. There was much talk as to whether
it were better to score by match only, or by aggregate
of holes won and lost only, or by a combination
of the two. I favoured the combination, but lost,
and "matches only" has always been the scoring
adopted.</p>

<p>It is not to be denied that we of England received a
very grievous shock when we learned that Jack Graham
was not going to play on our side, but intended to throw
in his golfing lot with Scotland, the country of his
origin. Of course he had a perfect right to do so.
He is a Scot,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I believe on both sides, but then the idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
had been, in the institution of this match, trial of the
golf learnt in England against the golf of Scotland, and
if Jack Graham himself was pure Scot, his golf was pure
Sassenach, every stroke of it learnt on that Hoylake
where he lived. It is not too much to say that that
decision of Jack Graham upset the balance of forces
very materially, for this match was always (save for
one occasion) played before the amateur championship
tournament, and Jack was, and is, a terrible player
in the early stages of any meeting. It is apparently
his constitutional misfortune that he is not able to
last through a long sustained trial. Twice certainly,
and I think three times, I have taken one of the bronze
medals of the championship while he has had the
other: that is to say, that both of us have survived
to the semi-final heat. But further than that, Jack
has never been able to last, and has been beaten
at that point by men to whom he could give three
strokes comfortably in ordinary circumstances and
in the earlier stages of the tournament. He has been
a terrible disappointment to us all, in this way, for a
more brilliant amateur golfer never played. It is his
health that has knocked him out every time&mdash;a lack
of robust nerves.</p>

<p>This going over of Jack Graham to the enemy, as we
regarded it, introduced another small trouble into the
International Match. It was always said (with what
basis of fact I hardly know) that it would cause too
much "feeling" in Hoylake if he were pitted against
either Johnny Ball or Harold Hilton in this match.
So the sides had to be so arranged that this terrible thing
should not happen&mdash;it was all rather farcical. As it
was, I had to play Jack Graham in the first International
Match, which was at Hoylake, and took a sound beat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>ing
from him. That first fight was the occasion of a
battle royal between Johnny Ball and Bobby Maxwell,
the former only winning, though it was on his own
green, by a single hole on the thirty-six. During
these years Bobby was rather regarded as the champion
of the Scottish amateurs, and the International
Match would be notable, if for nothing else,
for the Homeric contests between these two. The
most fantastic of them happened in the year when
exceptionally, as I have noted above, the match was
played before, not after, the amateur championship.
It was at Muirfield, in 1903, when I got into the final,
only to be beaten handsomely there by Bobby Maxwell.
We played the International Match the next
day, and I had to fight Fred Mackenzie, who afterwards
went as a professional to America and is now at home
again and playing very good golf at St. Andrews. He
did not play very good golf that day, however, though
it was good enough to beat me; for I found myself
not tired exactly, but utterly indifferent, after all the
strain of the championship, which I had had to endure
up to the final round, and could not tune myself up to
concert pitch at all. But on Bobby it was very clear
that the strain had not told in anything like the same
way. He played extraordinarily. I do not believe
that Johnny Ball played badly at all, yet he was
beaten, I think, by more holes than any other man
ever has lost in the International Match. Whenever he
did a hole in a stroke over the right number, Bobby
Maxwell did it in the right number; and whenever
Johnny did it in the right number, Bobby performed
a miracle and did it in one less.</p>

<p>One of the most amusing matches I ever did play
was with Gordon Simpson, a few years later, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
International when again it was at Muirfield. On the
first round I was four up at the fourteenth hole; and
then I let him win all the last four holes, so that we
came in to luncheon all even. Then, in the next
round, he was four up at the fourteenth, and, exactly
as I had done in the morning, so he, in the afternoon,
let me win all the last four holes. He got a good three
at the thirty-seventh&mdash;the hole was in a very "kittle"
place and the green was mighty keen, so that the
three was hard to get&mdash;and so won the match.
But in the course of that match I did a thing that I
never have done before or since. He laid me a stimy,
with his ball so near the hole that the only chance
was to pitch my own ball right into the hole. By a
bit of good luck I did it, but by a bit of unconscionable
bad luck, the ball, after rattling about
against the tin inside, came out again and stood on the
lip of the hole. As the match was played, it just made
the difference; but even had I won, it would not have
made the difference in the whole team match. Scotland,
as usual, were too good for us and had a match
to spare.</p>

<p>I had played Gordon Simpson once, many years
before, in the amateur championship, when he was
a student at St. Andrews' University, and the circumstances
had been amusing. He was the champion
of the University, and when we set forth from the first
tee we were accompanied by a gallery which appeared
to me as if it must include all the youth of that venerable
seat of learning. They behaved wonderfully
well, with a great deal of sportsmanlike consideration
for my feelings, but at the same time were naturally
so dead keen on their own man that they would have
been something more than human, or older than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
undergraduates, had they been able to refrain from a
little baring back of the teeth, and just the murmur of
a growl, when I happened to hole a good putt. Unfortunately
things went rather badly for their hero
at the start. I contrived to get a lead of some four
holes on him, and hung on to them till the match
was finished. Of course I did my best to win, but I
never in my life won a match which gave me less
satisfaction. It was so hard on the University
champion, surrounded by all his best friends. However,
he had his revenge, as said, at Muirfield. But as
for this stimy loft, into the hole and out again, it is
quite sure that there was something not just right
about the tins in use in the Muirfield holes at that
time, for it happened to Bernard Darwin to play
precisely the same stroke with precisely the same
result in the championship. The fact is that if the
flooring of the tin is set at a certain angle this chucking
out again of a ball lofted in becomes a dynamical
certainty. The makers of the tins ought to see to it
that the floor is not set at this angle. If it is set
nearly horizontal the thing does not happen, and it is
when set too vertically that it is almost bound to occur.
But, except for this case of my own ball and that of
Bernard Darwin's, I have never heard of another
instance of the kind, though probably golfing history
can furnish many.</p>

<p>The last occasion, before its death of inanition, on
which the International Match was played, it was
played in foursomes. I do not think that was an
experiment likely to prolong its life. With all respect
in the world for the foursome as a very pleasant pastime,
I cannot believe in it as anything like the test of
golf that a single provides. To me it is an infinitely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
more easy form of the game, though I am well aware
there are good judges and good players who think
otherwise. I can only say that for my own part it has
always been easier for me to play well in a foursome
than in a single. It is not, I believe, the common
experience.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think it is a pity that the International
Match is dead. There are many who would
like it revived. It gave useful practice to the young
players coming on, who thus had a chance, apart from
the championship, of showing what they could do in
good company. That was its value, more than as a
spectacle of the two countries set in array against each
other. Scotland nearly always had the better of us.
For one thing they have always seemed to lunch more
wisely or more well than we of England. Perhaps
their digestion is more powerful. At all events it has
happened again and again that we have been leading
finely at luncheon, only to be beaten decisively in the
end. But if we had had Jack Graham on our side
even this lack of the gastric juices would not, I think,
have turned the day so often against us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<h4>HOW MR. JUSTICE BUCKLEY KEPT HIS EYE
ON THE HASKELL BALL</h4>


<p>One night I was going North by one of the sleeping
trains and, having business late in the afternoon
in Holborn, did not return to the civilized parts of
the town, but dined at the Inns of Court Hotel. There
are little tables for two, and at mine was dining also
a man with whom I got into conversation. He told
me he came from Glasgow and was in town on a
business which he dared say I should think a very
curious one&mdash;a big lawsuit pending about such a
small matter as a ball used in the playing of the game
of golf. Did I play golf? I said, "A little." I also
said that in all the history of coincidences this was
just about the most singular, for that I, too, had been
engaged as a witness in the very same case. It was
the case that the manufacturers of the Haskell ball
were bringing against the manufacturers of the Kite
ball. The point was to prove the Haskell patent good
for their protection in a monopoly of making rubber-cored
balls. The Haskell people had asked me to
give evidence, because I was the first man to play
with these balls in England, and because I considered
them, and <i>pace</i> the law, still consider them, an absolutely
new departure in golf-ball manufacture.</p>

<p>It would be ungrateful not to think that providence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
designed this meeting at the Inns of Court Hotel, for
my new friend was able to tell me what the right fee
was for me to charge as an expert witness. He told
me that that was what I was&mdash;an expert witness.
I did not know it before, although I knew, without
his telling me, the ancient divisions of the species
"liar," into "liar," "d&mdash;&mdash;d liar," and "expert witness."
I was prepared to play my part, especially
when I heard, with pleased surprise, the large fees
paid for witnesses of this expert and unimpeachable
character.</p>

<p>So, in due course of time, I was summoned up to
London to attend the trial. I suppose other trials
are sometimes as humorous, but I could not have
believed it possible that there could be such good
entertainment as I found in that Court, where I sat
with much enjoyment calculating, between the acts,
the sum to which my expert witness fees were mounting
up as I waited. The Judge, Mr. Justice Buckley, if I
remember right, was not a golfer; yet the way in
which he kept his eye on the ball during the three
days or so of that trial was above all praise. And the
ball took a deal of keeping of the eye on itself, for
there were many balls of different sorts brought into
Court, and they were constantly running off the judge's
desk, and tumbling and jumping about in the body
of the Court, where learned gentlemen knocked their
wigs together as they bent down to search for them.
There was an old lady who said she had made balls
which were practically identical with these Haskells
all her life&mdash;balls for boys to play with. So she was
commanded to go away and to come back with all her
apparatus and to show in Court how the balls were
made. She returned, and it appeared that, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
some winding of thread about a core, the next proceeding
was to dip the balls into a molten solution of
some boiling stuff which smelt abominably. She
cooked this up in Court, and the whole business was
very suggestive of the making of the hell-broth of the
witches in "Macbeth," only that perhaps the Court of
Law did not give a striking representation of the
"blasted heath." The balls were apt to escape from
the old lady when they were half cooked and to go
running about the Court where the barristers, retrieving
them, got their fingers into the most awfully sticky
state and their wigs seemed to be the appropriate
places on which to rub the stickiness off.</p>

<p>Willie Fernie was there, enjoying himself hugely too.
He, it seems, had long ago made a ball resembling the
Haskell. There, too, was Commander Stewart, whom
I had known in the early eighties at St. Andrews. He
was the maker of the "Stewart patent" balls, which
had a vogue for a time, though they had not the least
resemblance to the Haskell balls. They were of some
composition, quite solid, and with iron filings in them.
Nevertheless, Commander Stewart, as it appeared, had
made a ball similar to the Haskell, though it could not
have been the one known as his patent. All these were
testimony to what the lawyers call "previous user."</p>

<p>Then an old gentleman was called who said that he
had played at ball as a boy with another old gentleman
whose name he gave, with a ball similar in all its
essentials to the Haskell golf ball. The other old
gentleman was called then, and he was asked whether
his memory corroborated this, and whether it was
in essentials the same ball. To which he answered,
to the delight of the Court, that it was not the same
ball at all. "What then," asked the Counsel, in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
profoundly shocked voice, "do you mean to say
that you think your old friend is a liar?" "No," he
replied quite readily, "I don't think so, I know it."
I looked out to see these two old friends going out of
Court, to discover whether they were quite as good
friends as they had been before, but I could not see
them.</p>

<p>I do not remember much about my own testimony.
I think what I said was true, but I am nearly sure that
it was quite unimportant. The present Lord Moulton,
I remember, examined, or cross-examined me, but he
did not turn me inside out very badly, and I believe
I left the Court "without a stain on my character,"
according to the stereotyped phrase. At all events
the conclusion of the whole matter was that we lost
our case very handsomely. The Judge, considering
the evidence of the old lady, of Commander Stewart,
of Willie Fernie and so on, said that he thought there
were sufficient witnesses to "previous user," and
no doubt "Messrs. Hutchison, Maine and Co."&mdash;I
think this was the name of the firm opposing us&mdash;fought
a good fight in the best interests of the golfer,
for it would have been a bad job for us all if there had
been a monopoly in the hands of one firm of the manufacture
of the rubber-cored balls. They put the prices
up against us fairly high as it was, without that.
Had there been a monopoly of manufacture we might
now be paying five shillings each perhaps, instead
of half-a-crown, for the balls&mdash;a very solemn thought.
They carried this case to the Court of Appeal, but that
Court only confirmed the finding of the Court below,
and thereto added this further comment, that whether
there were "previous users" or no, they did not think
that the invention in itself had sufficient novelty for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the patent to be good. So that "put the lid on," to use
homely phrase.</p>

<p>A while afterwards I met the American manager of a
big athletic outfitting house, and he told me that in
his opinion, looking at the thing with the commercial
eye of the manufacturer, if the Kite people had been
"real cute," they would not have driven this fight to
a finish. Instead, they would have come to the Haskell
people, when the case seemed likely to go in favour
of the defendants, and come to a compromise with
them. They would then have abandoned the case,
as if despairing of success, under a secret agreement
with the Haskell folk to allow them to make balls on
certain agreed terms. The effect of that would have
been that the abandoning of the case would have
frightened other companies out of ever bringing the
like case against the Haskell Company, and the two
might have gone on merrily working their monopoly,
at the expense of the ball-buyers, "till the cows came
home." That, as my friend the manager said, would
have been "real smart," but I think we have to congratulate
ourselves that this real smartness did not
commend itself to the Scottish firm that fought and
won this historic battle. We pay enough for our golf
balls even now, even under the relatively blessed
conditions of competition.</p>

<p>Surely it is not for me, who went no further in study
of the law than to eat, though indifferently to digest,
those singular dinners at the singular hour of six o'clock
at the Inner Temple, to criticise the high findings of
the law, but it does seem to my uninstructed wisdom
that if ever there were a substantially new invention,
making a new departure, it was this of these that we
then called Haskells and now call indiarubber-cored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
balls. Nobody, before Haskell, had ever given them
to us as reasonable things with which to play the game
of golf. He gave them to us as the best balls hitherto
invented. They spoilt the game in a sense, it is true.
The ability to hit the ball absolutely exactly has not
the same value now as in the days of the solid gutty
ball; nor does forceful hitting count for as much.
On the other hand, the greater resiliency of the ball
makes the game more pleasant, especially for weak
muscles. But that, the quality of the ball, is another
story. The story the Court had to sit in judgment
on was woven round about the question whether
substantially the ball was a novelty. They found
that it was not, and we all should be very thankful
that they did find so; but at the same time it is quite
possible that we may think it a queer finding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP OF 1903</h4>


<p>In the twentieth century I was no longer regarding
myself with great seriousness as a likely champion,
and it is very certain that I should not have troubled
to go to Muirfield for the amateur championship of
1903 had it not been for a kindly invitation from David
Kinloch to stay with him for it at his place Gilmerton,
about nine miles from the course. I was salmon
fishing on the Wye at the time, and the river was in
good order, so it was a wrench.</p>

<p>I remember that there was staying also at Gilmerton
on that occasion poor Harold Finch-Hatton, most
humorous of good companions. We used to drive
the nine miles in a high dog-cart, the horse generally
taking fright at the railway crossing at Drem each
morning; so the excitement of the day began long
before we came to the links.</p>

<p>I only arrived the day before the fight began, and I
remember my first tee-shot in that championship as if
it were yesterday. I was playing Mr. Frank Booth,
affectionately known as "Father Booth" to men of
Sandwich. The spectators were drawn up in a line
parallel with the line of play to the first hole, and I
hit my tee-shot on the extreme tip of the toe of the
club, so that it went out to cover point and right away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
to the right of the spectators altogether. I had to
play back over their heads, up to the hole.</p>

<p>After that promising start I played quite steadily
and beat Booth comfortably. Then I went along
uneventfully till I met A.M. Ross. A.M. Ross
was already something of a veteran, but he gave me
some extremely tough work. The match had its
element of humour. We had not, at that time, the
rule that all putts should be holed out, and very early in
the match he did not give a putt which I thought to be
stony dead. Therefore at the next hole, where he had
a putt still more stony, I did not give that to him.
He repaid me again by making me perform a still
more ridiculous task of holing out; and so I him again,
until at the end of that match we were scrupulously,
but without a smile or a word said on either side, holing
out putts of two inches with the solemnity of a religious
rite. But it was all with quite good temper on both
sides: I think both of us were too old stagers to take
offence. In the last eight I beat Dick, playing very
steadily, and then I met Angus Macdonald. I had
never played him before. He was, no doubt, an
immensely strong man. He was so strong and big
that he seemed unable to swing round his body, as it
were. He was the shortest driver for a player of his
ability I ever met; but he was also the longest putter.
Time and again, when I thought I had the hole, having
arrived on the green a stroke before him, he upset
calculations by holing a gigantic putt. He smoked
all the time, a long meerschaum pipe, and had all the
air of a man playing the game for pleasure&mdash;which
is not at all a common aspect for a man to wear when
he is playing a championship heat. And after he had
been holing these prodigious putts time after time, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
I had been following them up by holing humble little
things of a yard and a half or so, he fairly petrified
me with astonishment by remarking, in a tone of almost
pained surprise, "You're putting very well!" I
looked at him to see whether he was chaffing, but his
face did not show the twinkle of a smile, and I had to
assume that it was simple honest comment, and that
he was accustomed, that he expected, to hole these
gigantic putts, but that he did not expect his opponent
to hole the little ones after him. Perhaps that explains
how, being so short a driver, he was yet so good a
golfer. But eventually I defeated him, and thus came
into the final.</p>

<p>In the other semi-final tie a terrific battle had been
raging between Bobby Maxwell and Herman de
Zoete. Of course I did not see it, being very fully
occupied with Macdonald, but I heard all about it,
and what I heard was that Herman de Zoete was
driving tremendous balls, very seldom on the course,
and following up these huge erratic efforts by wonderful
recoveries and putting, so that, as they said, if he had
beaten Bobby, who was playing a sound steady game
down the middle of the course, it would have been a
crying iniquity. But it was an iniquity that was as
nearly as possible perpetrated: he had Bobby, as a
matter of fact, stone cold. This was at the nineteenth
hole, which they had to go out to play, having halved
the round; and at that hole I believe that Bobby's
first shot was in the neighbourhood of the wall and the
second still some little way from the hole. Herman's
first was short of the green, but not very short. It
looked as if he had but to do that hole in four to win
the match, and it did not look as if he could fail to do
it in four. But then, as he told me afterwards, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
first time in the whole match nerves got hold of him,
and having hold of him they seem to have taken their
hold very hard. He was unable, he said, to see the ball
with any distinctness. It looked all in fog; and, playing
at it through this obscuring atmosphere, he sent it
about a foot. The end of the hole was that Bobby,
by holing a very missable putt, did get a four, and
Herman took five and lost the hole. The tale, as told
me, was peculiarly painful to listen to, for though Bobby
Maxwell is a very pleasant fellow to play with, still,
for the final round of a championship, especially over
Muirfield, I would rather have had to play Herman de
Zoete.</p>

<p>However, there it was. And then an unfortunate
thing, for me, happened. On the next day we found
the wind exactly opposite in its direction to what it
had been all the week before. Of course that did
not make any difference to Bobby, to whom every
grass-blade on Muirfield was a personal friend and
every distance known to a foot, no matter in what trend
or force of wind. But to me, who had been painfully
learning the distances all these days, the right about
face of the wind put a very changed aspect on the
business. Not that I believe for a moment that the
ultimate result was affected by it. I have no delusion
that in the year 1903, or possibly in any other, I could
make a match with Bobby over Muirfield. Elsewhere
it might be another story. As it was, I did make a
very good match with him for fourteen holes, for at
that point we were all even. But then I made the
fatal error of letting him win the last four holes of
that round. I hardly know how it happened, for I
do not remember that I played these holes extraordinarily
badly, but I do know that I did not have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
nearly as good an appetite, when we went in for luncheon,
as I should have had if the break had come at the
end of fourteen, instead of eighteen, holes. To start
out, as I had to, afterwards, to give Bobby four holes
up, was rather a large order, and I found it a good deal
too large for me to fill.</p>

<p>I did not play badly. I had a vision of bringing him
down to quite a reasonable number of holes up, and
making a close match of it, at one point on the way out,
but there&mdash;it was the hole before the windmill&mdash;he
made a great recovery out of the rough and won the
hole which I had looked forward to winning. I took
three on the green and he only took one. That was
the final touch. He played the rest of the round,
as far as we had to take it, far better than I did&mdash;drove
much farther, for one thing, which is always useful&mdash;and
finally hammered me out by the tune of seven and
six to play. He deserved to win by quite that margin;
but I still cannot help rather regretting that attack of
nerves which seized Herman de Zoete so unfortunately
at the approach to the nineteenth hole the day before.
One thing, however, that championship taught me,
that if I was to live with some of these younger golfers
and harder hitters I must do something to add yards
to my driving. And the way I tried was by adding,
as soon as I went South, inches&mdash;to the number of
six&mdash;to my wooden clubs, both driver and brassey.
And it had its effect. The extra length was useful
at all angles of the wind, but especially against the
wind, and for some years these long clubs did me very
good service. Of course, the longer the club the lighter
you must have the head. That has to be understood,
for otherwise you get a weaver's beam that is quite
unlike the club of the balance that is familiar to your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
hand. But if you reduce the head-weight judiciously
you can lengthen the shaft unbelievably without making
accurate hitting any harder. And with the longer
shaft it seems, according to my experience, that you
get a longer ball.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<h4>TRAVIS'S YEAR</h4>


<p>In 1904, the amateur championship being that year
at Sandwich, Frank Penn<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> entertained me for it at
Bifrons, near Canterbury, about fifteen miles from the
arena of action. He used to motor me in each day,
and the driving of a big motor through the streets
of Sandwich town appears a very cork-screwy business.
Nevertheless he accomplished it perfectly and never
once bunkered us by the way.</p>

<p>I came across a lot of old friends and enemies at
that meeting&mdash;first Johnny Laidlay in the International
Match, then Mure Ferguson, if I remember right, in
the first round of the championship; I forget whom
then, but I know that a few more heats brought me up
against Johnny Ball. All these adventures, even that
last and worst, I succeeded in getting through with
success, and then I had to meet Bobby Maxwell on
the last day but one of the play. I was playing fairly
well, being much helped by the longer clubs I had
taken to since the Muirfield championship, where Bobby
beat me in the final.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Staying, as I was, with Penn fifteen miles away, I
did not hear much of the gossip going on at this championship,
but from time to time I did find one man or
the other coming to me and saying, "Have you seen
that American who is putting with an extraordinary
thing like a croquet mallet? He's putting most
extraordinarily well with it." Of course I had not
seen him: I had been too busy myself, putting by no
means extraordinarily well. That sort of thing was
said, now and then, but no one thought any more about
it. It was known that some Americans had come over
and had entered for the championship, but if anybody
had prophesied that one of them was likely to give
trouble or to get into the final heats he would have
been looked on as a lunatic. The truth is, that we
much under-rated the American amateur at that time.
Partly, I suppose, this was our "d&mdash;&mdash;d insular insolence,"
but partly, too, it was due to the very
successful tour in the States, a year or two before, of
a team of the Oxford and Cambridge Golfing Society.
They won their matches so consistently as to give us
the idea that the Americans could not play golf.
The man with the mallet putter was in process of
teaching us better, though even yet we did not realize
it. Mr. Harold Reade, the Irishman, ought to have
beaten him, for he was two up and either two or three
to play, but the American played the final holes very
finely and just won. So he survived, until in the heath
before the semi-final, wherein I had to meet Bobby,
he had Hilton to play. But Hilton was in no sort
of form and Travis beat him as he pleased. Meanwhile
I beat Bobby and had revenge for the year before, in
the Muirfield final, but it was by no means as I pleased.</p>

<p>I started badly and let Bobby win the first three
holes. Then I steadied down and he gave me chances.
It is always a different thing playing Bobby anywhere
else than at Muirfield. Had he gained this start<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
there I should never have seen the way he went. But
he let me get hole after hole back until on the eighteenth
green we were all even, we had played three
apiece, I was stone dead and my ball laid him a dead
stymie. It was not a stymie at all difficult to loft.
There was nice room to pitch the ball and let it run
on into the hole. Still, at that crisis of the match,
it was a fine piece of work on Bobby's part to play it
perfectly as he did. Then I holed my unimportant
little putt and we had to start out to play extra holes.</p>

<p>My second shot to the first (or nineteenth) hole, I
put carefully into the bunker guarding the green.
Bobby, I suppose, determined to be over, seeing that
I was in, rather over-ran the green. A bunker near
the hole never had the terrors for me that it has for
some people: we were too familiar with them at Westward
Ho! Tom Vardon said to me afterwards,
respecting the stroke which I played out of that bunker:
"That was a plucky shot of yours, to go straight
for the hole like that." Of course it is always pleasant
to be told one is a hero, but really there was nothing
very heroic about this. If the sand were taken at the
right point behind the ball there was no trouble about
the stroke. If you hit differently from your intention
there was bound to be trouble, but that is the case with
most golfing strokes.</p>

<p>What happened in this case was that I howked the
ball out fairly near the hole, about a couple of yards
off, perhaps, and Bobby, playing from the far end of
the green, put his just inside it. But whereas I had a
straight up-hill putt to the hole, he had to come along
the curve of the slope, so that my putt was far the
easier. I holed it all right. Bobby allowed a little
too much for the slope and that was the end of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
business. "Now see, Horace," he said, as we walked
back to the club-house, "that you don't get beaten
by that American."</p>

<p>I started out in the afternoon without the smallest
idea in life that I was to be beaten by "that American";
but I had not played two shots before I knew
that all the best of the fight had been taken out of me
by that stiff morning match. As Andrew Kirkaldy
said to me afterwards: "That," pointing to Bobby,
"that was your murderer." He had, in truth, done
most of the killing, and Travis had but to finish it.
He did not really play very well. Still, he was one up
on me going to the thirteenth hole, and there gave me
every chance of winning it and squaring the match,
but I played a very bad shot, and followed it with
another indifferent one, and so let him win that hole
which I ought to have won. He gave me no further
chances, and beat me by, I think, three and two. But
I reckoned things up afterwards and found, by the
score of the holes, that if I had played as well as
I did in any of the previous matches, I should have
been up on him, instead of down, at the point where he
beat me. That, however, is what makes an amateur
champion&mdash;that, amongst other things&mdash;the ability
to "stay" through a long fight and not to suffer
reaction after a hard match.</p>

<p>In the final, Travis had to meet Ted Blackwell,
and I never had great hopes for England as to the
result of that encounter. I say this, with all respect
for Ted Blackwell's great game as he developed it
almost immediately afterwards; but he was not his
great self then. At that time he was still putting with
a thin-bladed little cleek which must have been forged
about the date that Tubal Cain was in active work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
as a smith. Very shortly afterwards someone, who
deserves to suffer lingering death at the hands of all
Ted Blackwell's later opponents, induced him to take
to an aluminium putter. The difference it made in his
game was nearer a third than four strokes, as I reckon
it. From a really bad putter he became all at once
a very good putter indeed. I knew all about it, for
I had been playing him and beating him comfortably
in several matches at St. Andrews, in course of a little
party which Lord Dudley took up there. I met him
again in an international match at Hoylake only a
little later, when he had exchanged the tinkling
cleek for the aluminium putter, and he beat me&mdash;not
by length of driving, but by length of putting.</p>

<p>As for this final at Sandwich, which was played in
his pre-aluminium days, Travis has put it on record
that he felt confident of winning from the start; and
he looked like a winner all through. With the black
cigar and the deliberate methods, including the practice
swing before each stroke, he was perhaps rather a
hard man to play against, but at the same time, and
although I have said that he did not play very well
when I met him, I think those critics make a great
mistake who say that he was not a first-class golfer.
He was, and is, a wonderful putter. I know that,
not only by the wonderful week of putting that he
put in over here at that time, but by what Jim Whigham
and others who have played a great deal with him in
America have told me. Whigham said that you were
grateful, thinking that you had a lucky escape, if you
were his opponent and he did not hole the ball from
fifteen yards. This was at Garden City, where he
knows the greens better than his drawing-room carpet.
Indeed, all Travis's record disproves the statement that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
"he was not fit to win the championship." That he
was "lucky to win" we must think. Unless a man is a
head and shoulders above his field, he has to have
luck if he is to live through a tournament such as our
amateur championship; and Travis had no such head
and shoulders advantage as this. But put him down
at a hundred and eighty or any less number of yards
from the hole, and there was no player, amateur or
professional, better than he. Perhaps there was no
amateur as good. His weakness was out of bunkers
and rough ground, but that was a weakness which
troubled him little because he very seldom got into
these difficulties. I hardly know whether he would
have won our championship if Ted Blackwell and the
aluminium putter had been introduced to each other
a few years earlier; but it is no use arguing about "ifs."
As soon as he had won that final, the price of Schenectady
putters went up a hundred per cent., and Bobby
Maxwell, by way of insult, made me a present of one
of them, with which I often putted till our legislation
banned them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<h4>HOW GOLF HAS GRIPPED AMERICA</h4>


<p>The difference in the golfing condition of the
America which I had last visited in the early
nineties and that to which I went again in 1910,
was striking, and not a little amusing. On that former
visit I had given an exhibition of golf to a few indifferent
spectators at the Meadowbrook Club on Long Island,
on which they had reported that it "might be a good
game for Sunday"&mdash;conveying thereby a studied and
profane insult both to the game and to the day. On my
return in 1910 I found an America even more completely
in the throes of golf than any portion of our native
islands. But on this visit my approach to the American
courses was made in an unconventional manner
that is worth a word of notice.</p>

<p>Lord Brassey had asked my wife and myself to come
with him, on the <i>Sunbeam</i>, to Iceland, across the Atlantic
to Newfoundland, and up the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
The first golfing place at which we put in,
after joining the yacht in the Cromarty Firth, was
Dornoch, where is as glorious a natural links as the
soul of the golfer can desire or his most industrious
inquiry discover. The conformation of Iceland, chiefly
mountain, or plain strewn with lava-blocks, hardly
seems to lend itself kindly to golf; but on arrival,
after many days, during some of them rather storm-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>tossed,
at St. John's, Newfoundland, we found there a
golf course, still a little in the rough, carved out of
primeval pine forest, of undulating surface, astonishingly
good considering how new it was, and promising
to give really amusing and good golf of the inland type
in the future. Neil Shannon, a Troon man, is the professional,
and I astonished both myself and him by
beating him.</p>

<p>The next point at which we touched golf was Tadousac,
a watering-place at the mouth of the famed Saguenay
River which runs into the St. Lawrence. It is the
oldest fur-trading station in Canada. Here is a short
course, much <i>accident&eacute;</i>, at two points traversing a
deep ravine which has real sand in it. There is a
more elaborate and carefully kept course at Murray
Bay, a little further along the north shore of the St.
Lawrence.</p>

<p>At Quebec, on the Heights of Abraham, in a magnificent
situation, is one of the oldest courses in North
America. I was beaten by a putt by the better ball of
two of the native golfers, Mr. Ash and Mr. McGreevy.</p>

<p>Noble hospitality was shown us, both in Canada
and in the States. Scarcely could one be permitted
so much as to pay for one's own caddie, and any question
of green fees was dismissed as quite out of the
picture.</p>

<p>We sailed up to Montreal on the night of August
12th, and on the 15th I find the following note in my
diary: "Mr. Huntley Drummond took me around in
his car, after luncheon, to the Bank of Montreal, where
we picked up Mr. W. Clouston, and went out to the
Beaconsfield course&mdash;not at all a bad green, of the
inland type, flat in general, but with the club-house
set on a hill from which most of the course is over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>looked. They do themselves very well in the matter
of club-houses in this country&mdash;most commodious,
with bathrooms and all kinds of luxuries." On the
following day I played on the Dixie course, also quite
near Montreal, "a really good one&mdash;inland in its type,
as all are over here, but interesting and varied and
very pretty at a certain corner where much use is
made of a stream, with weeping willows, and so on.
There is one respect in which the architects of the
course might have been more clever, for they have so
ordained things that all the hazards are on the left,
all the penalty is for the pulled ball, and a man may slice
and slice to his heart's full content, and never suffer.
The turf and the greens are very good, and the butterflies
and grasshoppers very numerous, and large and
splendid of hue."</p>

<p>At Montreal we said good-bye, with many tears, to
the <i>Sunbeam</i> and her host, and made our next stop
at Toronto, where are two excellent courses. On
August 19th I find in my diary that "self and A.E.
Austin beat Lyon and Breckenridge on the Lambton
course." This Lyon is that Mr. George Lyon whom we
have seen over here competing in our amateur championship.
He has not done himself justice on this
side, for he is a very fine player. He has won the
Canadian championship often&mdash;precisely how often,
I forget. "Lambton Golf Club very comfortable,"
my notes record, "piano set out on balcony, lawn
tennis court and all 'amenities.' Beautiful view of
course from house&mdash;natural sand in bunkers&mdash;very
pretty, with woodland, water and undulating open
country. The course is laid on several big levels in
terraces. You play across a stream again and again&mdash;it
is no course for non-floating balls. Some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
greens are irrigated by sub-surface pipes from the
stream, leading to porous tiles, from which the hot sun
sucks up the water to the surface. I saw a thing this
day that I never saw before&mdash;played a ball up to a
hole that had the flag standing in it; the ball jumped
up, wrapped itself up in the flag, and stayed there
swaddled up in the flag. Query&mdash;what is the rule that
meets the case?"</p>

<p>The next day I played with Mr. Edgar on the Toronto
Club's course, but this is being given up to the builders,
and the Club is moving to a course further out along
the lake. There is a third course, also, for the Toronto
folk&mdash;Rosedale&mdash;which is well spoken of. On the
whole I was very much struck with the quality of
these Canadian courses of which we hear but little
over here. Among inland courses they take a very high
place.</p>

<p>Thence we went on by night, a sixteen hours' journey
to Boston, where Charlie Macdonald, the creator of
the National Golf Links of America, met us. Immediately
on arrival we started out for the Myopia Club,
where Macdonald and I beat T. Stephenson and
Leeds. The last is the constructor of the Myopia
course, and for its construction deserves no little credit.
From what I have seen of American courses I put the
National Golf Links first and this Myopia second, a
very good second. The National is that much-talked-of
course of which it was said that it was to be composed
of replicas of the eighteen best holes that its creator
could anywhere discover, and he journeyed over all
the courses in Europe discovering them. My notes
on Myopia course run: "fine inland course&mdash;rather
many blind shots" (but some of these, I know, have
been eliminated), "steeply undulating, sloping greens,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
no trees&mdash;good test of golf, long and trying. Record
in competition 75."</p>

<p>My next golfing note touches the Brookline course.
"Went out in Willett's car to Brookline, the County
Club. This is a tree-y course, like New Zealand, really
good, good greens, well bunkered, a trifle on the short
side, but full of interest. At all the American Clubs
great care is taken in bunkering the courses." This
last note is worth attention, because I see it is a comment
of Vardon, after his visit in which he and Ray
had to lower the British flag to Mr. Ouimet, that the
bunkers on the American courses were not severe
enough. But he did not see the National Links.
That would have satisfied even his passion for bunkers.</p>

<p>My notes continue: "Lunched at Brookline, then
motored thirty miles to Essex Club, where Charlie
MacDonald and I again beat, as we had already
beaten in the morning at Brookline, T. Stephenson
and Willett. The course tree-y, like Brookline, with
great hills here and there. Natural sand in the bunkers&mdash;a
fine course. Rather in transition state, as I saw
it, but with all the making of a good thing."</p>

<p>I see that I was at Myopia again on the 23rd, when
Charlie MacDonald and I again beat Stephenson and
Leeds. In the afternoon we went to see Mr. Fricks'
grand collection of pictures at his house on North
Shore&mdash;a fine sight, though "not golf." But there
was little rest from golf when we arrived, at 3 p.m.
on the 24th, in New York, very hot and dusty. Macdonald
motored us out to his house at Rosslyn and
then took me for a round at Garden City in the evening,
where I beat him in a single. "Course very
brown and baked," according to my diary, "but quite
long, and putting greens good. Rather ugly sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>roundings,
but fine test of golf. No trees as hazards,
except a line of them on right of the 17th, which is a
very good hole. The finish is to a short hole over a
pond. Doubtless a good course, but not very inspiring."</p>

<p>On the 25th I see that "Charles Macdonald and self
played F. Herreshoff and L. Livingstone, at Garden
City, in morning, but lost by a hole, and in the afternoon
Herreshoff and self played our better ball against
the best ball of C. Macdonald, L. Livingstone and R.
Watson, but lost by a hole again." I have a note
appended to this day's golf: "Never played worse&mdash;eyes
bad with heat and motoring."</p>

<p>I may break off here to give a hint to the British
golfer visiting the States. I doubtless got a little
"touch of the sun" on this day at Garden City, and
it is a thing that the Briton coming fresh to American
golf has to be very carefully on his guard against.
He is menaced, really, by three dangers&mdash;the blaze
and glare of the sun, the abounding energy of the native
golfers and their abounding hospitality. Between
the three he is in much peril of being overdone, as I
quickly was. I played golf on various courses afterwards&mdash;on
the Shinnecock Hills, finely undulating,
but too short and with too many blind shots, where
natural advantages have not been turned to the
best possible account; at Easthampton, where, for two
holes, you actually find yourself among real seaside
sand dunes (unhappily this blessed dispensation does
not last); on the National Links, of which I have
already noted my high appreciation; at Baltusrol,
very tree-y and very hilly, but a good, interesting
course, and others too many to name.</p>

<p>Their witness suffices. It suffices to show the zeal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
and kindness of your American hosts in taking you vast
distances to play on many courses. It shows the vengeance
that golf has taken on them for that comment
on it of a quarter of a century ago when I exhibited
to them some feeble sample of it and they said that
it might do "for Sundays." There are men in
America now who will play golf even on a week-day.
In fact golf is, with many, the real interest of
their lives. They do a bit of work, no doubt, urged
by the painful necessity of earning a livelihood,
but there are many whom their work does not
grip. A quarter of a century ago the business men
of New York talked dollars: to-day they talk golf.
It is a very sanitary change. And not only will
they talk golf, but they will spend money on it. The
care that they take of their putting greens would hardly
be credited, without being seen. It is not enough for
them that the turf shall all be of grass, with no blend
of weeds: it is demanded that it shall be all of one
variety of grass, and that variety the finest. The
National Golf Links has not only every green watered;
it is watered all through the green, from extensive
sprinklers kept going all night long in the dry weather.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE END OF THE ROUND</h4>


<p>I did not see the finish of the amateur championship
of 1905 when Gordon Barry beat Osmond Scott,
but I understand what the moral of that match was&mdash;that
indiarubber handles are not good things for a
soaking wet day. We have had one or two terrible
soakers for the finish of the amateur championship,
and for the open championship too, in the last few years.
The worst that ever I saw was that in which Johnny
Ball beat Palmer in 1907 at St. Andrews. Almost the
whole links was water-logged, it had been raining during
most of the week. Johnny Laidlay prophesied that
the man who would win the championship would be
the man that had most changes of clothes, for one got
wet through every round. I do not know how many
changes Johnny Ball had, but I do know that he looked
dead beat both in the semi-final and in the anti-penultimate
heats, and that anybody else would have been
beaten. It was only his wonderful match-play ability
that took him through. He was not playing at all
well, in spite of his win. In the final it never looked
for a moment as if he could fail to win, and his greater
power, in weather like that, gave Palmer, who was his
opponent, mighty little chance with him. After that,
to commemorate his sixth amateur championship, the
Royal and Ancient Club did itself honour by electing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
him an honorary member. But he was far from having
finished with the championship even then; and I
much doubt whether he has finished even now.</p>

<p>One of the interesting features of recent golfing
story is the rise of fine players of the working-men
class in England, as well as in Scotland, and at Ashdown
Forest, where I lived for some years, the Cantelupe
Club, and especially the great golfing family of Mitchell,
has become famous. They became famous even before
one of the family, Abe, rather took a big share of fame
to himself. I had a cousin, Tom Mitchell, in my garden,
who was nearly as good as Abe, and when I had a
golfing guest staying with me and did not want to play
golf myself, I used to say, "There's a boy in the garden
will give you something of a game, if you do not mind
playing with him." That guest always came back
from his game in a very chastened frame of mind.
Abe Mitchell chiefly made good his name by fine
play in the amateur championship, and most of all
in that of 1912, when the tournament was played
for the first time at Westward Ho! That is the last
of its kind that I attended, and I had to go to that
because it was on my own old home course. I drew
Denys Scott to start with, and I am afraid neither of
us played very faultless golf. But he redeemed the
match by some very fine runs up with his aluminium
putter, and beat me.</p>

<p>One of the episodes of the match was that the poor
"Old Mole" came out to watch it, bringing with him
a small pack of whippet dogs which danced about us
as we played, to the exasperation of tried nerves. I
have already paid due honour to the great work that
he did in early days for English golf, and it is only
while these pages were in course of writing that his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
death happened, where so much of his life had been
passed, at Westward Ho!</p>

<p>Johnny Ball won his eighth championship at this
Westward Ho! meeting, and his final opponent was
Abe Mitchell. I was referee and saw the whole of that
match. Johnny had only escaped by the skin of his
teeth, and by his imperturbable match-playing ability,
from the hands of Mr. Bond, in an earlier heat. Mr.
Bond had been five up, no less, and eight to play.
And then he drank a bottle of ginger-beer, and never
did a hole in the right number afterwards. But it is
all to Johnny Ball's credit, and just like him, that even
when his fortunes were thus apparently desperate he
never did despair. He, for his part, went on doing
the holes in the right number (which was more than
he had done on the way out, when he lost five holes),
and won at the nineteenth after a halved round.</p>

<p>Abe Mitchell was not hitting the ball at his hardest
in the match with Johnny, but both played well. In
the afternoon it came on to pelt with rain, which suited
Johnny, but Abe did not mind it either. The match
stood all square with three to play and Abe laid Johnny
what looked like a very dead stymie at the sixteenth,
but Johnny somehow got round it. Abe won the
seventeenth, thus making himself dormy, and both
were on the last green with two shots each. Johnny
holed out in two putts, Abe just failed to do so. Then
they halved the thirty-seventh hole&mdash;not with quite
blameless golf on either side&mdash;and at the thirty-eighth
Abe topped his tee shot heavily, and that was the end
of it.</p>

<p>I regret to say that I did not go to Muirfield in 1909;
for they had one of the finest finishes there of any
championship. Cecil Hutchison was a hole up and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
two to play in the final against Bobby Maxwell: he
did the last two holes in four and five, and the last on
that day was very hard to reach in two. We may
almost say that he did both in the right number.
Yet he lost both, and therewith the championship, to
Bobby, who did them in three and four. The three
was scarcely human.</p>

<p>It is not very easy to find a man who, all through his
golfing time, has delighted more in the storms and the
rain than Johnny Ball, but I believe there is one&mdash;that
same who came as a little flaxen-haired boy to our
house at Northam&mdash;J.H. Taylor. He is open champion,
for the fifth time, as I write, and he won that
championship at Hoylake in weather as villainous,
especially on the second day, as any that has generally
been served out to us for the finals of the amateur
championship. One cannot say worse of it. He had
a stroke or so in hand, of the whole of his field, at the
start of that second day, but the curious thing is that
when the rest of the professors saw what kind of day
it was, they never doubted that Taylor would win.
He has a mastery over the ball in these circumstances,
both in the drive and in his low and heavily cut approaches,
that none other can rival&mdash;not even Vardon
nor Braid themselves.</p>

<p>In respect of these more recent years I find that my
reminiscences begin to deal more and more with things
I have seen and less with things I have done&mdash;which
is as much as to say that they must begin to lose the
vivid personal touch. In 1908 the Royal and Ancient
Club did me the high honour to elect me, first of Englishmen,
as their Captain. As one of my wife's relations
was good enough to say&mdash;"I'm glad they've made
Horace that&mdash;it will look so well in his obituary notice."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
So it will; but I hope not yet. I had great ambitions
to win the medal on the day that I struck off the
ball whereby I played myself in as Captain, but though
I contrived to hit that ball, and actually to hit it into
the air, I was not well enough to take part in the medal
play. In the winter of 1909 a little party of us&mdash;Tony
Fairlie, Charles Hutchings and myself had been at
Westward Ho! I had not seen the course for seven
years, and it struck us all, with one accord, as the
finest thing in golf (did we make reservation in St.
Andrews' favour? I hardly think so) that we had
ever seen. And during that visit I had played better
than I had played for years and years before. I was
in great delight and really had visions of a renewed
youth and of having "got it back." And then
returning home, I caught the worst go of influenza
that I ever have had, which is a great deal to say, and
never played golf properly again.</p>

<p>At the moment of writing it is most unlikely, according
to all the doctors say, that I shall ever play, properly
or improperly, again; but it would not do for me to
grumble. I have had a very full and pleasant golfing
day&mdash;much interrupted, it is true, by illness, but still
as extensive as a reasonable man could ask. And if
all active part in the game is to be denied in the future,
at all events I can still take interest undiminished in
the work and play of others. Golf is not only the best
of games to play: it is also, in many respects, the
best to look on at. You cannot sit still, it is true, in
the comfort of the pavilion, nor are aeroplanes as yet
fitted with silencers so efficient that a match can be
watched from them without discomposure of the
golfer's nerves, but in the very fact that you must walk,
and even run, if you are to see much of the game<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>&mdash;such a meteor as Duncan is not to be caught without
much sprinting&mdash;there are compensations. Watching
a modern golf match means a good deal of healthful
exercise and produces a more hearty appetite than
sitting in the pavilion at Lords. As for the rival
merits of the games, I need not raise so vexatious
a question now at the very finish of the long round
which the reader may have been patient enough to
endure with me. Let it suffice to say that, whatever
other games may be, golf is good enough. If golf,
taken sanely and considered in all its various aspects,
fails to satisfy us, we must be hard to please; and I
will ask you to note, as one of the aspects worth considering,
the very striking growth of the game in
favour during the half-century over which this record
runs.</p>

<p>So the last stroke is played.</p>

<p>Or is it, of a certainty, the last stroke after all?</p>

<p>That is a question which at once is raised&mdash;not
fancifully, but in all seriousness&mdash;if we are to place
any credence whatever on such revelations as, for
instance, Sir Oliver Lodge gives us in <i>Raymond</i>,
as we have in <i>Claud's Book</i>&mdash;Claud actually states
that he has been golfing&mdash;or as Sir Conan Doyle
strenuously affirms to be proven true to his satisfaction.
If any one of these even so much as approximate to the
fact, in regard to that world to which we go after death,
it must then be evident that it is a world so like that
in which we live and labour and play golf for our
relaxation now, that it is impossible but to think that
there must be something of the nature of the same
pastime in that "beyond." Such revelations, if we
attach value to them at all, inevitably carry the inference
that we shall there find golf, together with other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
conditions not widely different from those that we have
known on earth&mdash;not any "fancy" golf on illimitable
Elysian Fields, with never a bad lie on the whole
immense, monotonous expanse, but real golf, difficult
golf, golf with bunkers and all incidental troubles
to be overcome&mdash;not without vexation of spirit&mdash;golf
in which (for we cannot presume an infinity of
halved matches), one or other player will be beaten.</p>

<p>So it may be. It needs at least equal boldness
to deny it as to affirm it. And, if it be so, arises then
the further question: "Will those who are champions
now, be champions then? Are we to carry on, into
that beyond, any portion of the skill acquired so painfully
here below? Will Harry Vardon still be, golfily
speaking, Harry Vardon there?"</p>

<p>It scarcely seems an equitable prospect. Have we
not more reason, and even some high authority, to
suppose that the blessed law of compensation will
be in operation: that the first here will be the last
there, and the eighteen-handicap man, now the scratch
player, or better, of that bright future?</p>

<p>This is the vision splendid, for the many&mdash;on which
they may gratefully close the page.</p>

<p>Windsor Castle stands alone among the buildings of Great
Britain. It is the greatest among our early fortresses and the
most splendid of Royal Palaces. The story of English Building
during eight centuries is very fully written in the stones
of Windsor, but not so that every one may read. The slow
accretions of centuries are not easy to disentangle, and it
needed the skill and wide arch&aelig;ological experience of Sir
William H. St. John Hope to set out in its true proportions
the fascinating story of the growth of this great architectural
organism.</p>

<p>The edition is limited to 1,050 numbered copies, of which
nearly 400 were subscribed prior to publication. It has been
printed from new type on pure rag paper, specially made for
this edition. It is illustrated by exquisite reproductions in
colour of drawings by Paul Sandby; by a large number of
collotype plates reproducing a unique collection of original
drawings, engravings and photographs which show the Castle
at every stage of its development, as well as by beautiful
woodcuts, prepared expressly by the great engraver Orlando
Jewitt for this History, when it was first projected. Many
of the illustrations are reproduced for the first time, by special
permission of His Majesty the King, from originals in the
Royal Library at Windsor.</p>

<p>The work is issued in two sumptuous volumes, together
with a portfolio containing a notable reproduction of Norden's
View of Windsor and a complete series of plans, specially
printed in fourteen colours, which show the dates of all the
buildings in the Castle and their successive changes.</p>

<p>With the continuous development of garden design there
has arisen an increasing demand for a practical and comprehensive
book entirely devoted to the right use of Garden
Ornament, and this volume has been carefully designed to
meet that demand. Every word, every illustration in the
volume conveys a lesson to the reader, and the publishers
feel they are entitled to congratulate themselves and the
public upon the fact that Miss Jekyll, whose reputation in
garden design is world-wide, was induced to undertake the
authorship of the book.</p>

<p>The right use of water in the garden; the happy employment
of Steps and Gateways; the skilful placing of Garden
Houses, Sundials, and Seats; the definite value and proper
construction of Pergolas; the use of climbing plants; the
wanton growth and misuse of ivy and other creepers, are all
depicted and described in an authoritative and exhaustive
manner.</p>

<p>Examples are furnished from the finest gardens in the country
of beautiful Balustrading; graceful Gates, Urns, Vases,
and Sculptured Ornaments, Stone Paved Courts, Paved Ways
and Garden Seats, Loggias, Orangeries, Garden Houses and
Dovecots, Parterres, Sundials, Topiary Work, Pergolas and
Treillage, Canals, Ponds, and Water Gardens, Bridges, Fountains
and Dipping Wells, Flower Borders, Wall Gardening
and Japanese Gardens.</p>

<p>The teaching value and beauty of the illustrations ensure
an eager welcome for the book at the hands of all true garden
lovers.</p>

<h2>TWENTY-FIVE GREAT
HOUSES OF FRANCE</h2>

<h5>WITH AN INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER OUTLINING THE

<p class="center">By W.H. WARD, M.A., F.S.A., F.R.I.B.A.</p>

<p class="center">Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Frederick H. Evans</span>.</p>

<p>In this important work Sir Theodore Andrea Cook, author of "Old
Touraine," "Old Provence," "Rouen," etc., perhaps the most sympathetic
and skilful English writer on French history and the romantic associations
which linger around the Chateaux of France, presents a pageant of the
great figures who surrounded the throne of such kings as Fran&ccedil;ois Premier
and Louis Quatorze. Louis of Orleans at Perrefonds, the Duke of Guise at
Blois, Fouquet at Vaux le Vicomte, and Cond&eacute; at Chantilly&mdash;these are
typical of the story that the author unfolds, with a grasp so sure that the
men and women live again, while their great houses are depicted with a
wealth of illustration never before achieved or attempted.</p>

<p>The growing tendency to rescue old buildings from neglect
and the important problems which are raised by such work
prompted the issue of this book. Detailed descriptions
reveal how houses of bygone days have been re-equipped as
modern needs demand, without destroying the witness they
bear to the old traditions of building. Incidentally, the
author has shown in how many cases the records of modest
little houses have been preserved, and how intimately their
local story is woven into the larger fabric of national history.
The book is an invaluable guide to all who are desirous of
repairing an old house, and who wish to achieve it in the right
spirit.</p>

gardens, many of which have never previously been published.
Interspersed in the text is a large number of plans,
and there is an appendix of 22 pages giving a valuable series
of scale drawings of typical buildings.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The Manchester Guardian</i> says: "It is only when we see a publication
such as this that we realize what quality characterizes some of the building
of to-day. Abundantly and splendidly illustrated, this book shows the
work of a great master, whose influence is even greater than his most
enthusiastic admirers can appreciate."</p></blockquote>

<h2>GRINLING GIBBONS</h2>
<h4>and the Woodwork of his Age
1648-1720</h4>

<p>The Author's profound knowledge of the period and his
intimate acquaintance with the art of Gibbons in all its
manifestations give an unquestioned authority to a volume
which, for the first time, gathers together a superb body of
illustrations and detailed descriptions of all his best work.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The proprietors of <span class="smcap">Country Life</span> are rendering admirable service
with their series of Architectural Monographs. In writing a life of Gibbons,
Mr. Avray Tipping had by no means an easy task, but with painstaking
care he has collected all the available material, skilfully focused
it, and for the first time we have Gibbons presented in true perspective.
But Mr. Tipping's work is of more than biographical value. Equipped
obviously with wide knowledge of his subject, he has written a comprehensive
and luminous account of what may be described as the golden age
of wood carving in England."&mdash;<i>The Glasgow Herald.</i></p></blockquote>

<h3>MEMORIALS AND MONUMENTS OLD AND NEW:</h3>
<p class="center">Two hundred subjects chosen from seven centuries.<br />
By LAWRENCE WEAVER, F.S.A. With Collotype Reproductions
of 180 Photographs and 80 other illustrations.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Quarter bound, 15s. 8d. net; by post, 16s. 6d.</i></p>

<p>In this book the whole art of memorial design is for the
first time examined in all its aspects&mdash;historical, critical and
practical. Most of the monuments of recent years, and
notably those which followed the South African War, reveal
a lamentable poverty of design, and the chief aim of the book
is to establish a better standard. To this end the development
of memorial design in England since the Middle Ages
is clearly set out, and all possible treatments of modern
memorials are discussed, with an exceeding wealth of illustration.
To all who contemplate setting up a memorial,
whether it be a small tablet to an individual or a monument
to a great body of men, this book offers essential guidance.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Morning Post.</i>&mdash;"This beautifully printed and well-illustrated volume
is at once a history and a plea&mdash;a history of memorials and monuments
drawn from seven centuries, and a plea for better workmanship and finer
taste than are generally shown in the stone and brasses set up in our
churches and other public places. Its arrival is opportune. It will not
be the author's fault if the lapidary sequel of the great War is not better
than that of the South African Campaign. If architects and sculptors
will work together there is hope of better things, and here to hand in this
volume is description and illustration of 200 subjects, chosen from examples
of the last 700 years, which they may study to the end of learning
the rules in proportion, in the use of materials, the spacing of lettering,
and the like.... We agree with Mr. Weaver that our English ideas of
what is correct in memorials should be revised."</p>

<p><i>The Times.</i>&mdash;"To guide and help those who need guidance in these
matters."</p>

<p><i>The Athen&aelig;um.</i>&mdash;"Many will be grateful for these timely and suggestive
pages ... thoroughly well informed on the historical side of the question
... most catholic and soundly artistic in appreciation of certain
exceptionally good work of the twentieth century."</p></blockquote>

taken of birds. Every movement of their flight is now recorded; the
taking off, the alighting, the swooping, the settling, the 'planing,' the
struggling against the wind. And they are just the birds which the
ordinary man wants to know about, because he has such opportunities of
seeing them for himself on any walk along the cliff."</p></blockquote>

bird of prey left in England&mdash;combines the salient facts of
almost innumerable field notes <i>written at the eyrie itself</i>. It
is a book that should appeal with irresistible force to all true
nature lovers. Many striking and unexpected facts were
revealed to the author as a result of unwearying patience
in a diminutive hut slung from the precipice of a lonely islet.
These records are now set forth in a wonderful narrative which
discloses the life history of the Peregrine Falcon from the
moment of its hatching to the day it finally leaves the eyrie.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The Times</i> says:&mdash;"We commend this faithful and truly scientific
inquiry to all lovers of animals and to those who are in quest of a real

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
